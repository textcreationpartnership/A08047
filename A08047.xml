            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neuertheles diuers of them do euen breathleſly labour &amp; toyle in ſeeking to adde earth for their Sonnes to inherit; and yet are of ſuch nicenes and delicacy themſelues, as that they will not once ſtirre a foote, that (not their Sonnes, but) themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues may inherit, not Earth, but the true <hi>Land of promiſe,</hi> I meane the kingdome of God; but in lieu thereof though their leading a wicked lyfe, become inheritours of Hell fyre and euerlaſtinge damnation. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the moſt worthy <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> In the reading of this his Booke thou ſhalt doubleſly fynd him not to act <hi>Moyſes,</hi> who was permitted only to ſhew the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the way to the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> &amp; not to enter with them therein; but rather <hi>Ioſua,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into the <hi>Land,</hi> and alſo entred with them; which <hi>Land</hi> was

            <p>Touching my courſe held in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating this Treatiſe, thou mayſt be aduertized, that I haue tranſlated it faythfully and truly. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity ſcorns to vſe in his Writings any flowers of youthful Oratory; but only writes, whatſoeuer it pleaſed God to dictate vnto his ſpirit: Therefore I ſhould haue wronged him, and his worke, in diſueſting it of its owne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and eaſines of ſtile, by new cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it in forced and borrowed robes of ſpeach.

            <p>Now ſeeing a <hi>Houſe</hi> (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it be great) cannot containe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men; therefore, that wee ſhould not thinke that they are but few, who belong to the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> the Scripture doth annexe the Name of a <hi>Citty,</hi> which vſually comprehendeth in it ſelfe many Orchards, and many Pallaces of Pleaſure.

               <p>THe third reaſon, why that Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall habitation is called a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> is, becauſe in that Place is found the perfect forme of Gouerment.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> conſiſt of certaine and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men, or of the Communalty and more vulgar ſort. To wit, that in a <hi>Kingdome</hi> all ſupreme Soueraignty is inueſted in onely one; whereas in a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> it is ſhared and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among many. In theſe temporall Kingdoms of men, the ſupreme power
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14091:16"/> doth not reſide truly and properly in one man; For it may be, that a King without either the counſell or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of others, may giue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſuch or ſuch a thing ſhalbe done; but yet his directions cannot be put in execution, except his Subiects doe affoard their concurrency &amp; aide. And often it ſo falleth out, that the King cannot command (at leaſt dare not) the effecting of a thing, if ſo he ſtand in feare, to the multitude of his Subiects. For how many Kings and Emperours haue beene dethroned, whoſe authority the Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects haue ſhaken off, and often with death to the ſaid Kings and Emperours? Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are fraught with Examples of this ſubiect. Therefore that chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment in mortall Kings is languide and weake; ſince thoſe Kings cannot performe any thing, or atcheiue any exploite, without the approbation, and allowance of the People. But the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty of God, who alone is ſtiled (and truly is) <hi>The great King,</hi> hath no dependancy of any thing, but only of his owne <hi>VVill.</hi> The which his <hi>VVill</hi> (ſince it is Omnipotent) cannot brooke any reſiſtance; neither ſtandeth it in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14091:17"/> need of ſouldiers, warlike prouiſion, or any other endeauour out of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And although God doth vſe Angels, or Men, as alſo euen dead, and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things, as his inferiour Miniſters; yet this he doth not out of any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but becauſe it ſo beſt pleaſeth his diuine Will. For he, who without the miniſteriall aſſiſtance of any, created only by the vertue of his <hi>VVord,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Earth, and euery thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, and doth conſerue them only by his <hi>VVill,</hi> may alſo no doubt gouerne all things ſo created, only by his owne imperiall dominion. Neither only is God ſaid, moſt truly to rule, becauſe ſupreme, or (as I may tearme it) <hi>ſuperlatiue power</hi> remaineth in him alone; but alſo in that the chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of gouerning is peculiar only to him. For God needeth not any Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, or others to conſult withall. <hi>VVho hath knowne</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 11.) <hi>the mind of our Lord, or who hath beene his counſellour?</hi> And before the Apoſtle, <hi>Iſay c.</hi> 40. thus conteſteth the ſame, ſaying: <hi>VVho hath holpen the ſpirit of our Lord? Or who hath beene his counſellour, and shewed to him? VVith whom hath he taken counſell, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14091:17"/> who hath inſtructed him, and taught him the path of Iuſtice, and taught him knowledge, and shewed him the way of Prudence?</hi> Therefore it followeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitably from the Premiſſes, that a <hi>Monarchy</hi> (which is the beſt kind of gouerment) is not only found to bee in God; but it is found to be in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, true and perfect. For hee is not only formidable ouer all the Kings of the earth, as we reade, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. but alſo is a moſt Maieſticall King ouer all the Gods, as is ſaid againe in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94. For there are certaine <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> who are rather to bee called <hi>diuells,</hi> according to that of the Prophet: <hi>The Gods of the Gentils are diuells: Pſal.</hi> 95. There are alſo other Gods by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, as the Kings of the Earth, and the Angells of Heauen are, for we reade: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. <hi>I haue ſaid, you are Gods.</hi> But all theſe Gods ſtand ſubiect and obedient to that one ouerruling God, who reigneth in Heauen.</p>
               <p>The refore it neceſſarily followeth from what is aboue ſaid, that, that King is truly a King, and moſt puiſſant, whom <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> that faſtigious King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (after his pride was iuſtly puniſhed) in theſe words fully

               <p>THe fift reaſon of calling the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the Saints, the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen,</hi> may be taken from the ſimilitude and reſemblance of the Saints liuing in Heauen, to the goods, which terrene Kings do enioy: though thoſe of Heauen doe ſo much ouer-ballance theſe of the earth, and are greater then they, by how much Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is more worthy and noble then
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14091:23"/> the Earth. Therefore the Kingdome prepared for the bleſſed, is not ſimply, a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> but is called for more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpeach, <hi>the Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;</hi> that thereby we may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the like proportion here is of goods, to goods which is of the Earth to Heauen; that is, of a thing in it ſelfe narrow, baſe, ſordid, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, to that, which is moſt ample, moſt high, moſt noble, and (which is the chiefeſt) eternall and euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>The goods of a terrene Kingdome are accounted theſe, to wit, <hi>Power, Honour, Riches, Pleaſures.</hi> A tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall King may commaund ouer his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And hence it is, that Kings become feareful to their Subiects, and are reputed (as it were) certaine Gods. Againe, Kings wilbe honored with a certaine height of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and worſhip, almoſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending mans Nature; for they expect the bowing of the knee; neither will they ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vouchſafe to heare their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biects ſpeake but with a ſubmiſſe and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14091:24"/> humble cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, and deportement of body: and if they paſſe through the ſtreets, they looke that all men ſhould go backe and giue them the way. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, kings couet to haue a moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and rich Treaſury, repleniſhed with gould ane ſiluer: neither do they number their reuenews by hundreds or thouſands, but by ten hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; &amp; this not without iuſt reaſon, ſince they are not to mantayne ten or twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty ſeruants, or followers, but great &amp; powerfull armyes of ſoldiers againſt their enemies. Laſtly, they are not content to recreate themſelues, with accuſtomed ſports, but they hould it as neceſſary to the ſplendour of their greatnes &amp; maieſty to waſt many pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of gould and ſiluer, in banqueting, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in publike ſhewes and ſights. And theſe things aboue rehearſed are the ſole goods almoſt belonging to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes: which goods haue this one thing incident to them all; that is, that they are but momentary &amp; fading beginning at the birth of the Princes, and ending with their death, except perhaps it may fall ſo out, that the lyfe of the Kings be of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance then their Reigne.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:14091:24"/>
               <p>Furthermore theſe goods are not pure, but are accompanyed with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tings. Thus power is oftentymes bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced with infirmity and weakenes: Honour with ignominy: Riches with Pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

True it is, that Regall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is ſuch, as that the People do depend vpon the leaſt intimation or ſignification of the King his mynd; yet this his power is mixed with infirmity ſince the Prince reſteth vpon the ſtrength and courage of his people. For what can the command of a Prince eyther in beſeiging or defending a Citty effect, if his ſubiects eyther be not able, or not willing to encounter the Enemy? Neyther doth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prince reſt only vpon the ſtrength of his Subiects, but alſo in the walles of the Citty, of the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; of weapons, of miliitary ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and of Money, which is vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, <hi>the Sinew of Warre.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people reſt at the commaund of the Prince; and are ſubiect to one man; But the Prince relyeth vpon the Wills of many Men, as alſo vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other things, in all which he is forced in ſome ſort to be ſeruiceable.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:14091:25"/>
               <p>To conclude, it is in the Power of the King to chaſtize his ſubiects with bonds, impriſonment, baniſhment, yea with death: notwithſtanding the King himſelfe (I ſpeake what actually may be done, not what by right ought to be done) lyeth open to bonds, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, baniſhment, wounds, &amp; death. The truth of this point is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the pittifull examples of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar, Caius, Nero, Galba, Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Domitian, Commodus, Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi> and from diuers others. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do theſe wicked Princes, but ſuch as haue beene of great modeſty and moderation in their comportement, witnes the ſame; as <hi>Alexander Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a, Gordianus</hi> the yonger, <hi>Pertinax, Tacitus, Numerianus Probus, Gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Valentinianus</hi> the ſecond. I could inſiſt alſo in ſuch Princes, which haue beene moſt remarkable for piety and Sanctimony of lyfe; as <hi>S. Edward,</hi> King of England, <hi>S. Wenceſlaus,</hi> duke of <hi>Bohemia, S.

               <p>In this next place let vs diſcourſe of <hi>Honour.</hi> Kings indeede in their owne preſence, and in the preſence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14091:25"/> of others, are much reuerenced; but in their abſence they are often ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and their Honours turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey are much flattered by ſuch their Sycophants, who ſecretly beare to them a great contempt, and inward hatred. And if account ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both of ſuch, as extoll them in prayſe, and of others their detractours, theſe later would be found far more in number. Therfore doubtleſly the glory of Kings is for the moſt part leſſe, then their ignominy; ſince thoſe who in the preſence of a King, do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, are but few; whereas the abſent are many, of which ſome doe taxe the King with ſordide auarice, ſome with cruelty, others with luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and others with other vices.</p>
               <p>To deſcend to <hi>riches.</hi> Perhaps ſome may thinke, that Kings haue no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pouerty adioyned to their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Nothing leſſe. For no men are found to be more wanting, and poore then Kings. They haue indeed great reuenewes and treaſure, but withall they often are indebted more they their Treaſure can diſcharge. And that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14091:26"/> man is not ſo poore who hath litle, as he who deſireth much, becauſe he wanteth much. And is it not a great argument of Pouerty, for Kings to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort farthings or halfpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nies from their Subiects, being poore, ſince they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſmall cuſtomes or payments of all thoſe, who ſell things neceſſary for mans ſuſtenance and prouiſion? I ſpeake not this, as reprehending ſuch exactions, fot I well know that Kings may iuſtly require theſe Tributs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe words of the Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Be ſubiect not only for wrath, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; therefore giue you Tributs alſo, for they are the Ministers of God &amp;c. Render therefore to all men their due; to whome tribute, tribute; to whome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, custome.</hi> Onely my intention heere, is to paint out the miſerable ſtate of mortall Kings; who of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are to abound with great affluence of riches, and yet are forced to gather no ſmall part thereof from poore and needy men.</p>
               <p>But now in this place what ſhal we ſay of the <hi>pleaſures</hi> and delicacies, which Kings enioy? Kinges indeed haue their gardens, their bowers, their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14091:26"/> Orchards, moſt ſumptuous tables of meate, their hunting ſportes, their theaters, and other ſuch pleaſures for their recreation; but theſe are often attended on with the goute, the griefe or paine of the ſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke, or Head, and (which is more violent) with moſt grieuous ſolicitude and cares of the mynd, which not ſeldome do depriue them of their nightly reſt: ſuch are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, feares, augours &amp;c. Thus if their Bedchamber dore doe but open, or make the leaſt noyſe in the night, they inſtantly ſuſpect treachery and treaſon. If newes be brought them, that there is ſeene a multude of armed men togeather, they feare a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Subiects againſt them. Thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is there made a compound of their ioyes and griefs, of their repoſe and diſquietneſſe; which hath beene the Motiue, why diuers Kings, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning all domination and Rule, haue finally choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue vnder the hatches of a priuate lyfe.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare S. <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> who diſcourſeth of the Emperours of his tyme in theſe words, <hi>hom.</hi> 66. <hi>ad pop. Antioch. Ne diadema reſpicias, ſed curarum tempestacem; neque purpuram

For in the day tyme death is feared, in the night the very ſoule ſeemes to leape out of the body, through apprehenſion of terrours. And theſe thinges happen in tyme of Peace. But if the trumpet be once ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that VVarres rush on, what lyfe is more miſerable, then the lyfe of Kings? How many dangers doe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars and ſubiects threaten to them? For the very pauement and stones of Kings Courts doe euen flow with the bloud of their owne friends and kinred. This will be fully acknowledged, if I doe inſist in ſome examples both of former times, and of our dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This King (for example) hauing a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14091:27"/> wife ſuſpected of Adultery, did tye her naked, leauing her to bee deuoured of beasts in the mountaines, though she became mother of many Princes. Now what kind of life may wee thinke this man did liue? For hee would neuer haue burst out into ſo great a reuenge, had he enioyed the true vſe of Iudgment. This other Prince did throtle to death his owne Sonne. This third being ſupriſed by his enemy, became his owne Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. Another muthered his owne Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, being Competitour to the Crowne. The fifth is reported to haue depriued his owne Brother of life. Another ended his life by taking Phyſicke being impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and the eye of his Sonne was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, for the preuenting of future dangers, when as yet he had committed no wrong. The next Emperour (as a Man, breathing only miſery and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity) was burned with his horſes, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and other his furniture. VVords light short to expreſſe the calamities which the next Prince to the former, was forced to ſuffer. And as for this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that now reigneth, is it not most euident, that after hee was crowned with the Diademe, he ſpent no short
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14091:28"/> time in labours, in dangers, in diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ſecret endeauours?</hi> At non talis Caelorum Regia; <hi>but ſuch is not the Court or Kingdome of Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre S. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> Who how truly he concluded, what wee ſhall now relate, will fully proue. For it is certaine, that the Kings of the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> (and ſuch are all the bleſſed, who doe liue with God) haue Power without weaknes, honour without ignominy, riches without Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerry, and pleaſure without griefe. For of them it is ſaid in the 90. Pſalme: <hi>There ſhall no euill come to thee, and ſcourge ſhall not approach to thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi> And in the <hi>Apocalyps cap.</hi> 21. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all teares from cheir eyes, and there ſhall bee no more death, neither ſorrow, neither cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither ſhall there be any more paine.</hi> Therefore the power of thoſe celeſtiall Kings is moſt great, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity and weaknes none.</p>
               <p>Wee reade in the 4. <hi>of Kings,</hi> that one Angell without any military for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without any artillery, or ſvvords or launces did kill at one blow a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty thouſand of <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> neither did the Angell feare to receaue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14091:28"/> any wound from them. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth in his third booke of <hi>Dialogues, cap.</hi> 36. how a holy man being aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a bloody and mercileſſe fellow, with his arme ſtretched out, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſword in his hand, inſtantly cried out: <hi>O Saint Iohn, hould him,</hi> And preſently thereupon his hand did grow ſtiffe, ſo as hee could not mooue it. Therefore Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> did heare the prayer of his Client from Heauen; and with ſuch celerity did puniſh that wicked Man, as that it preuented the blow, being already begun to be giuen. Such is the power of Celeſtiall Kings, as that neither almoſt an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place, nor the ſolitarines of one poore iuſt man, nor the multitude of armed men, could hinder S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> from deliuering his Suppliant from imminent death.

               <p>Now concerning the <hi>Honour</hi> of thoſe Kings of Heauen, it is ſo glorious, and great, as that not only the godly and vertuous, but euen the wicked, yea the very Diuells doe reuerence and giue veneration to them. Many doe contemne, and be trample vpon vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14091:29"/> and holy men here liuing vpon the earth; whome, after that they be tranſlated to Heauen &amp; their ſanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny celebrated by the publicke ſuffrage and decree of the Church, the former men doe worſhip and honour. And the Diuells themſelues doe reuerence and feare the relicks and Images of ſuch holy Saints in Heauen, whome whiles they liued in fleſh, they vexed with their temptations; yea often times with ſtripes &amp; blowes, through the permiſſion of God.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Riches</hi> of theſe Heauenly Kings? Their chiefeſt riches is to want nothing, ſince God to them is, <hi>All in al,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. for he is not rich, who poſſeſſeth many things, but he who deſireth nothing, ſince he wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth nothing. For it is the mynd, which maketh a man to be rich not his ſtored cheſts or coffers. We may add heerto, that Heauen and eatth, and what is therein contayned, belong to the riches of the Saints: for what do not they poſſeſſe, who are, <hi>the heyres of God, the coheyres of Christ? Rom.</hi> 8. And whome, the Father will conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>the heyres of all things. Heb.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>There now remayneth to ſpeake of

                  <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Certainly the pleaſure, which the celeſtiall Kings enioy, is moſt pure and cleare, not contaminated with any droſſe of griefe or dolour. For we haue aboue learned out of the <hi>Apocalyps c.</hi> 21. that God ſhall wype away euery teare from their eyes, and that they ſhall not ſuffer any more lamentation. But touching <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> we ſhal enlarge our ſelues more in diſcourſe hereafter when we treate of Paradiſe. Now it is euident from what we haue aboue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, that the goods of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen</hi> ſhalbe common to all the Saints and Bleſſed; and that they are of that worth, as that they cannot brooke any compariſon, with the goods of this world; eſpecially ſince all terrene goods are temporary: but celeſtiall goods, euerlaſting.</p>

               <p>NOw let vs a little obſerue, with what vehemency and heate of endeauour are earthly Kingdomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and ſought after by men, though they be vncertaine, ſmall in their own nature, and euen fraught with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite feare and ſollicitudes; that from thence we may gather, with what a thirſty deſire &amp; ardour the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> ought to be ſought after. The greedines of Domination &amp; Rule doth incomparably exceed all other humane deſires: Since a Kingdome is not one only particular good, but it is a maſſing or heaping togeather of all the goods, which may be deſired of men. For there is <hi>Power, Honour, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleaſure,</hi> as is aboue ſayd. There alſo is found a liberty of liuing after ones owne will; which is incident &amp; gratefull not only to men, but alſo to

Many thinges might be alledged in proofe of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but I will content my ſelfe with one reaſon. To wit, that perſecution is like to a forge of burning fire. For fire doth prepare and dreſſe meates, doth purge ſiluer, and proue gould: Euen ſo perſecution, if it be patiently ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, rectifieth, and diſpoſeth Sinners, refineth the imperfect, and is a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to the Iuſt: And thus is perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become ſeruiceable to all ſortes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14091:41"/> of men. A ſinner is lyke to raw fleſh, vvhich except it be rightly dreſſed, is caſt forth to the beaſts to be eaten, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For perſecution, or grieuous tribulation violently ruſhing vpon a ſinner, he inſtantly forgetteth all luſt, lucre, and ambition, and ſo becommeth transformed, and another man, from vvhat before he vvas.</p>
               <p>A iuſt man (but weake and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) though hee doth not fall into any grieuous ſinne; yet he is a fauourer of his fleſh, followeth his pleaſures, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth gaine and wealth, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the vanities of the world; This man is like vnto ſiluer mixed with much droſſe; but if once the forge of Perſecution take hould of him, and that with patience hee entertaine it, then preſently the refuſe matter in him doth beginne to bee ſeparated

But I, vvho am Truth it ſelfe, neither can I, nor ought to conceale the truth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue here added, That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God cannot be taken but by ſuch, as offer great violence, ſo as only men of violence doe carry it avvay. Hence it is, that in another place I haue ſaid, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. <hi>How hardly shall they, that haue money enter into the Kingdome of God? For it is eaſier for a Camell to paſſe through the eye of a nedle, then a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> And againe: <hi>How narrow is the gate, and how straite is the way, that leadeth to life: And few there are, that find it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue alſo compared the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> to a <hi>Treaſure</hi> hid in a Field, as alſo to a <hi>precious Margarite</hi> vvhich cannot be bought, vvithout the ſale of all other things; intimating thereby, that a man muſt depriue himſelfe of all things, vvhich he holds deare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, if ſo he hope to poſſeſſe the celeſtiall Treaſure, and precious <hi>Margarite</hi> in Heauen, I haue further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more perſpicuouſly, and vvithout any

Novv if the building of a Tovver vvithout good ſtore of money; and the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in vvarre and hoſtility againſt a potent King, be things moſt difficult, and almoſt impoſſible: Hovv much more difficult then is it to performe both theſe tvvo points together? But hee ought to performe them, vvho vvil beſiege or lay battery to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
               <p>For firſt, a Tovver is to be built,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14091:44"/> vvhich may reach to Heauen; That is, merits and the price of good vvorks, are to be procured, vvhich may deſerue eternall life. And with all he is to fight vvith very many and moſt potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to vvit with the vncleane &amp; vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Spirits; vvho ſhall labour by their ſubtile endeauours to hinder the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the foreſaid Tovver. The <hi>Tipe</hi> or figure herof happened to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elits,</hi> vvho endeuouring to reedify and build vp the Citty of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then ruined and beaten to the ground by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> were hindred by their neighboring Countreyes, vvarring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; ſo as they vvere forced to vſe incredible ſollicitude and care in building vvith one hand, and fighting vvith the other. From all vvhich the Concluſion is, that the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> cannot without great paynes and ſweat be purchaſed by ſuch men, who become a prey to earthly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſures and benefits; not knowing how to bridle and tame the Concupiſcence of the fleſh, or to fight with an inuiſible enemy. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, whoſoeuer, being aſſiſted by the the grace of God, ſhall ſeriouſly giue his mind to Chriſtian Perfection, and

               <p>ANother reaſon, why the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of God may be called the <hi>Citty of God,</hi> ſeemeth to be, in that a <hi>Kingdome</hi> is accuſtomed to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend within it almoſt an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of perſons being among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues diſtinct in language, Manners, and Lawes; of which number (though all of one <hi>Kingdome</hi>) many did neuer ſee one another, much leſſe euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted any mutuall friendſhip or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity.

               <p>THe third Reaſon, why the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> may be called a <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is, in that a <hi>Kingdome</hi> hath a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall forme o gouerment, which ſeemeth to be oppoſed to liberty; whereas all the <hi>Cittizens</hi> of Heauen, are free, and our Mother, which is the ſupreme <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is alſo free, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth to the <hi>Galathians c.</hi> 4. Which bleſſed Apoſtle did well know, what he did ſpeake, ſince he being once taken vp in ſpirit into the third Heauen, was thereby acquainted with the manners, and lawes of that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore ſeeing a <hi>Kingdome</hi> doth ſeeme to include ſeruitude, and a <hi>Citty</hi> liberty; that <hi>Kingdome</hi> may well be called a <hi>Citty,</hi> in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch all, who ſerue the King, are free. Now among the holy inhabitants of Heauen, there is not one only liberty, but a liberty of ſeuerall kinds. For firſt, all the <hi>Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> of Heauen are free from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14091:52"/> of ſinne, ſeeing the firſt liberty, which was in the terreſtriall <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> was to haue power <hi>not to ſinne;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſecond liberty in the celeſtiall <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is far greater; to wit, <hi>not to be able to ſinne,</hi> as <hi>S. Austin</hi> teacheth. <hi>lib. de correp. &amp; gra c.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Another kind of liberty conſiſteth in being free from death, being like to the former liberty. For <hi>Adam</hi> vvas ſo free in the terreſtriall <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as that it vvas in his povver not to dye: And the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are ſo free in the celeſtiall <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as that they cannot dye.

                  </gap>ace liberty in that, vvhich conſiſteth in not being able to doe; ſeeing not to be able to ſinne, and not to be able to dye, imply an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of freedome from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of ſinne, and thraldome of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. For vvho hath not povver to ſinne, is not only free from ſinne; but alſo is ſo farre from the bondage thereof, as that he remaines ſecure, that ſinne ſhall neuer haue any ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty ouer him. In like ſort, he vvho cannot dye, remaines not only free from death, but is ſo farre diſtant from death, as that he is aſcertained, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14091:53"/> death ſhall neuer make any aſſault to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards him: Which liberty only <hi>God</hi> through his owne Nature enioyeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>VVho alone hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> For although the Angells and rationall ſoules be ſaid to be naturally immortall, becauſe they haue no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or cauſe of Corruption in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ature; Neuertheleſſe, God who firſt created them, can at his pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to Nothing. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and the bleſſed Saints are moſt ſecure, that they ſhall for neuer after ſinne, nor dye; and are in this reſpect moſt free from the ſeruitude of ſinne or death; which priuiledge is a moſt honorable participation of the diuine liberty of God.</p>
               <p>The third kind of liberty, is to be free from Neceſſity; and this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is alſo of ſeuerall ſorts. For now mortal men are forced (through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conſtraint of neceſſity) to eate, to drinke, to ſleepe, to labour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to ſtand, another time to walke, or to lye downe, and repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But the Saints in Heauen ſtand ſubiect and thra l to no ſuch neceſſity, but are freed from all corporall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14091:53"/> And this is the liberty of the glory of the Sonnes of God, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his Epiſtle to the Romans. Now of what dignity this liberty is, firſt poore men, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly ſpirituall men, laſtly rich men, &amp; ſuch as are louers of this world, do fully teſtify. Men oppreſſed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and want in the higheſt degree, what indefatigable paynes d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And how much would they acknowledge themſelues to be obliged to ſuch men, who would disburden and free them from all ſuch ſeruitude of Want &amp; Neceſſity? And hence it is, that many of them practiſe theft, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited courſes, for the maintayning of their liues; for they ſay with that wicked Steward in the Ghoſpell <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. To dig I am not able, to beg I am aſhamed, I know what I will do: To witt, I will deceaue my Lord; I meane, I wil free my ſelfe by theft and rapine from this burden of want and neceſſity. But the cloſe or end of this is to fall into a neceſſity far more grieuous; that is, into the ſeruitude
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14091:54"/> of ſinne and the diuell, mans greateſt enemy.</p>
               <p>To come to holy men who greed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirſt after Heauen; theſe men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it a great burden, to haue the care of prouiding al things n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Marke</hi> the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, were ſo wholy deuoted to their accuſtomed heauenly meditations, as that they neuer refreſhed their.

Yea he relateth, that diuers, for the ſpace of three whole dayes, others for ſix dayes togeather, abſtayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate. In like ſort <hi>Ioannes Caſsianus</hi> in his <hi>Collations,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his <hi>history,</hi> do affirme, that the ſame long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rmites. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from hence we may gather, that the ſeruitude of corporall neceſſities was a great clogge to theſe men; they complaining and crying out with the Apoſtle: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Vnhappy man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the body of this death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to deſcend to the Cittizens of this World, and particularly to rich men (who breath nothing but temporall gaine and pleaſures:) To theſe this ſeruitude of neceſſity is not vngratefull; neuertheles if they wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed the matter in an euen ballance, they would cenſure it to be moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. Meate, drinke, and ſleep are pleaſing to them, but if theſe benefits of nature be taken in a ſuperfluous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they fill the body w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Agayne ſuch men are violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned eyther to profeſſe open em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to God, and thereupon to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe his moſt dread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14091:55"/> the fleſh for the obtayning of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſobriety; which kind of feight is accuſtomed to be moſt labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and moſt dangerous. Therefore I conclude, that both the poore, the rich, the godly, and the wicked, are disburdened and freed of a moſt faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious weariſom neceſſity and vaſſilage, when they are freed from the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this miſerable and manifold Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The fourth kind of liberty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, in being free and vnobliged to the Law, and the Precepts; ſince the Law was inſtituted not for the iuſt, but for the iniuſt, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teacheth. Now there are none more iuſt, then the <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> for they are confirmed and corroborated in Iuſtice, neither can they poſſibly become iniuſt. True it is, that the threatning and preſſing Law is not ordained for iuſt men, liuing in this World; ſince of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, they are obedient to the Law; neuertheleſſe it cannot be denied, but the Law doth oblige and direct euen them to do that, which the law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and to flye that, which the Law prohibiteth.</p>
               <p>But the iuſt, who doe enioy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14091:55"/> of the glory of the Sonnes of God, doe ſtand in need of no Law, for they conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate all Iuſtice in the <hi>VVord;</hi> and as being ſtrenghtned and fortified in perfect Charity, they cannot deflect or decline from the will of God. This liberty indeed is of great moment, which diſchargeth one of all ſollicitude and anxiety; and it is wholy oppoſite to that captiuity &amp; thraldome of thoſe vnfortunate Soules, who hauing their hands and feete bound, ſhalbe caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>exteriour darknes,</hi> and into a <hi>furnace of fire;</hi> So as they ſhall not be able either to tolerate, or to auoid thoſe torments. And yet there is not any man, but of neceſſity he muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe one of theſe two contrary lotts or fortunes. Notwithſtanding men are ſo blinded with the empty ſmoake of preſent Honour, and the duſt of terrene Benefits, as that they make no cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no introuerſion of iudgment vpon theſe matters, vntill a ſudden ouerthrow and calamity doe ruſh vpon them; and thus doth irreuocable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment open their eyes, vvhich ſinne had before ſhut, and cloſed vp.</p>

               <p>From this it followeth, that the whole <hi>Citty,</hi> whether you reſpect the gates, the wall, or the ſtreets, is moſt precious, which hath not within it any ordure, or any thing that is baſe, abiect ſordid, or of ſmall continuance.

The Euangeliſt by the gates <hi>being open,</hi> ſheweth, that that <hi>Citty</hi> is ſo ſecure and free from all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile incurſions, as that it needeth n t to ſhut its Gates; much leſſe to keep any Watch, or Centinall.</p>
               <p>But let as proceed, and ſhew, what the <hi>Gates,</hi> the <hi>VValls,</hi> and the <hi>Streetes</hi> of his Citty do import?

               <p>VVE haue already taken into our conſideration the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the ſupernall <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> we will now intreate of another ſtructure thereof.

And perhaps the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and liuing togeather vnder the ſame Lawes, is more properly called a Citty, then a continuation of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of houſes vnder the ſame walls; for thus doth <hi>Tully (in ſomni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Iohn,</hi> but alſo <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> do ſpeake. In the <hi>Apocalyps cap.</hi> 21. we read: that in the twelue gates, were ſeene twelue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the inſcription of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were the twelue Tribes of the children of Iſrael; and in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were written twelue names of the twelue Apoſtles of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>S.

               <p>Thus far S. <hi>Austin;</hi> Who fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth vs, that Chriſtians are true <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are the true Heyres of the Land of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which is in Heauen, And thus it appeareth, that the Gates of heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> haue the Names of the twelue Tribes of Iſrael written vpon them: becauſe the Port or Gate by the which entrance is made into that Heauenly Land of Promiſe, is the right, or title of the inheritance of the Sonnes of God; who alone are true
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14091:77"/> and ſincere Chriſtians, being the Sons of the Holy Apoſtles, which are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the name of <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> that is, by the Sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> the Patriarke. Now where S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth, that in thoſe gates were twelue Angells; this ſignifieth, that the Angells are the keepers or warders of the gates; their office being to take care, that not any doe enter therein, who haue not right of Inheritance: And perhaps for this reaſon, S. <hi>Michael</hi> (the Archangell) is pictured with a paire of ballance or weights in his hand, in that by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Angells, ſubiect vnto him, he doth examine and weigh the meritts of thoſe, who doe ſeeke to aſpire to this Heauenly Citty.

               <p>To conclude, it is neceſſary, that we be ſtones artificially <hi>wrought and ſquared;</hi> not ſtones vnpoliſhed, and without forme, becauſe ſuch building is beſt ſorting to the moſt noble Citty of all Citties. So we read, in <hi>Iudith</hi> 1. that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> (the King) did build the Citty <hi>Echatanis,</hi> of ſquared and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14091:80"/> cut ſtones. And if King <hi>Salomon</hi> built the Temple of our Lord heere vpon earth, of poliſhed, carued, and curious ſtones; what ſtones then ought to be vſed for the building of that Eternall Citty, which infinitly is exalted aboue all other Citties? But this ſquaring &amp; working is to be performed in this life and not in Heauen; The figure, or Type wherof, was the building of the Temple of <hi>Salomon;</hi> for thus we read in the third of the Kings <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>VVhen the Houſe was building, neyther ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor hatchet, nor any toole of Iron was heard in the Houſe.</hi> Becauſe the ſtones were hewed, cut, and ſo perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and euenly ſquared far from the houſe of the Lord, as that when they were brought to the Temple, they were put in their place, without any noyſe, or ſound of the Hammer.

Which of the Prophets eſcaped Perſecution and Iniuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the wicked? What tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not the bleſſed children of the <hi>Machabees</hi> endure? But let vs

Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>And now, ô <hi>Chriſtian Soule,</hi> what canſt thou reply hereto? If the hammer of the builder did not ſpare thoſe Men, of whome the world through their eminent ſanctity, was not worthy, that thereby they might be ſquared, laboured, and made fit for the celeſtiall Edifice: what then ſhall become of thee, and ſuch as are lyke to thee; to whome ſinne is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and gratefull, but all pennance &amp; ſatisfaction for ſinne, moſt grieuous and vngratefull? One of theſe two fortunes perforce thou muſt vndergo, to wit, eyther thou muſt be hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this life, or in Purgatory; or els thou ſhalt not haue any place in that ſublime building, but in lieu thereof

               <p>Neither oughteſt thou to ſleight or litle regard the Purgatory-refyning and hammering in the lyfe to come, ſince that puniſhment (though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall) is moſt grieuous and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of longer continuance then any Paine of this life.

But now becauſe the celeſtiall Cittizens are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly mixed with the earthly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, therefore the holy Scriptures ſay (for greater diſtinction) That the Cittizens of Heauen are <hi>in the VVorld, but not of the VVorld;</hi> And that they are in the World, not as Cittizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but as ſtrangers and Pilgrims, for S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>I beſeech you, as Strangers and Pilgrimes, to refraine from carnall deſires:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But of the Citizens of the earth the Scripture changeth its ſtyle, and thus ſpeaketh of them: <hi>They are ſtrangers of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14091:86"/> hauing no Hope of the Promiſe, and without God in this world, Epheſ.</hi> 2. Now theſe things being thus, Let no man deceaue himſelfe, nor dreame, that he can be a Cittizen of the world, and withall a Cittizen of Heauen. The Cittizens of the World, are of the World; The Cittizens of Heauen, are not of the World. To be of the world, and not to be of the world, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, and incompatible togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore cannot brooke any conuinction; In regard whereof let thoſe men then, (to whom the world and earthly matters are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) not perſwade themſelues, that they can haue any place in the Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Citty, except they firſt goe out, and (as it were) wholy forſake the world, voyding their iudgements and wills of all earthly Pleaſures, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts.</p>
               <p>But becauſe theſe Points are high myſteries, and are vnderſtood by few, at leaſt not thought and meditated on as they ought to be; therefore to the end, that no man at the laſt day may pretend ignorance, there is not any thing, which the Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts doe more often inculcate and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14091:86"/> repeate, then this one point; Heare our Lord: <hi>Ioan.</hi> 8. <hi>You are of this world, I am not of this world.</hi> Againe, he thus ſpeaketh to the Apoſtles: <hi>If you had beene of the world, the world would loue its owne;</hi> but becauſe, <hi>you are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Heare <hi>S. Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi> And againe: <hi>You ought to haue gone out of this world. And yet more; That we may not be damned with this world.</hi> Heare <hi>S. Iames: cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Know you not, that the friendſhip of this world, is the enemy of God? VVhoſoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a friend of this world, is made an enemy of God.</hi> Heare <hi>S. Peter: Fly the corruption of the concupiſcence which is in the world.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Heare <hi>S. Iohn: Doe not you loue the world, or thoſe things in the world:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan</hi> 2. And againe: <hi>If any man loue the world, the charity of the Father is not in him;</hi> And yet more <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>The whole world is ſet in wickednes.</hi> To conclude heare our Lord himſelfe, ſpeaking in prayer to his Father: <hi>Ioan</hi> 17. <hi>For them doe I pray, not for the world doe I pray, but for them, whom thou hast giuen me. And the world doth hate them, becauſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14091:87"/> they are not of the world, as alſo</hi> I <hi>am not of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from hence we may gather moſt euidently, that the world is ſo (as it were) excommunicated and curſed by God, as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> thinketh it not conuenient to pray for it. Yet may it be here obiected, that if <hi>Christ</hi> doth not pray for the world, how is it ſaid: <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſo loued the world, as that he gaue his only begotten Sonne?</hi> what, doth the Father loue the world, and the Sonne hate the World? Or how doth the Sonne exclude the world from his prayer, which the Father doth not exclude from his loue? S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expounding this later place, ſaith, that the world for whom Chriſt denyed to pray, ſignifieth only the wicked; according to which accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ſo that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer therefore doth thirſt after that ſupreme and high Citty, let him haſten to goe out of the world, for feare leaſt his laſt day may ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnexpectedly ſurprize him, and take him out of this life, when he ſhall be depriued of all hope of his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But if he be once happily gotten out of the world, then let him forſake the ſame with all its concupiſcences, that he may daily meditate only of the Citty of our Lord, and that he may euen proteſt with the Holy Prophet: <hi>If I ſhall forget thee, O Ieruſalem, let my right Hand be forgotten; let my tongue cleaue to my mouth, if I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber thee, if I ſhall not ſet Ieruſalem in the beginning of my ioy. Pſal.</hi> 136. For this is the true Character, or Note of the Cittizens of the Eternall Citty; to wit, to be more deſirous to want both tongue and hands, then to ſpeake, or attempt any thing againſt the loue of God their Father, and their Celeſtiall Countrey; that ſo the beginning of their ioy, may be the Citty it ſelfe, which repleniſheth its Cittizens with ſuch beatitude, as that no worldly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity

               <p>I hold it conuenient, to cloſe vp this Booke with the words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> that ſuch, who will not perhapps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue me, may not doubt to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto ſo great and worthy a man.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14091:90"/> painefully laboured in the Vineyard, or hath multiplyed his Talents, through negotiation and trafficke, or (as firſt) hath gained the <hi>Prize</hi> in the race; or hath deſerued the <hi>Crowne</hi> in warre &amp; ſpirituall fight; or hath diligently fed the ſheep committed to his charge, couragiouſly and valiantly defending them from wolues; for then ſuch a man, after the accompliſhment of all theſe his labours, doth with all alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; cheerfulnes enter into the <hi>Houſe</hi> of his Lord.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon heerof then is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14091:90"/> the bleſſed, though they be ſpred throughout the Kingdome of Heauen, are the domeſticks and familiars of our Lord.

                  </gap>nts do euer ſee God do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſe with him, and do ſpeake to him face to face; whether they be the ſupreme Seraphims and Cherubims, Patriarches, Apoſtles, Prophets, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Angels, and the loweſt Saints. For euen of our Angels Gardians, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the leaſt degree of Angells, our Lord thus ſaith: <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heauen alwayes do ſee the face of my Father, which is Heauen.</hi> And the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Epheſians cap.</hi> 4. auerreth, that all the Saints are not only the Citizens of God, but euen the domeſtick friends of God.

                  </gap>eſtiall houſe, and who ſeeth not God, and conuerſeth not with him, as a domeſticall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend; howſoeuer contrary heerto in other Kingdomes and Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there are many, who neuer ſee the King, and moſt few they are, to whome he vouchſafes any ſpeach, or familiarity,</p>
               <p>Another reaſon, why the <hi>Citty of God</hi> is called a <hi>Houſe,</hi> may ſeeme to be, in that in a Citty many do ſee the King, and do ſpeake to him; yet all thoſe are not the Domeſticks, Sonnes &amp; heyres of the King; but only thoſe, who dwelling in the Kings Pallace, are acknowledged by the King, for ſuch. But now in the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> and in the <hi>Citty of God,</hi> all the Saints,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14091:91"/> whether o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> higher or low degree, are truly the Domeſtickes of God, and Brethren of Chriſt; &amp; by reaſon heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are linked togeather in the ſtrait coniunction of fraternity or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; ſo as the Superiours among them do not contemne their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, neither with them is any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or malignity. For when our Lord did teach the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> that chiefe Prayer, which is daily to be recited; he in theſe words excluded not any man; and when at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſhall ſay: <hi>Come you Bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe you the Kingdome, prepared for you from the foundation the VVorld. Matth.</hi> 25. he ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any out of this moſt confortable inuitation. And when the Apoſtle ſaid to the Romans, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>whoſoeuer are gouerned with the ſpirit of God, thoſe are the Sonnes of God; and if Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Heyres alſo; Heyres truly of God; and Coheires of Christ:</hi> He in theſe words ſhutteth out no man, whether great or litle, ſo that he enioyeth the Spirit of God, and will ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſterned and guided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Which one Point is doubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly common to all the regenerate in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14091:92"/> Chriſt, perſeuering in Fayth, Hope, Charity. In like ſort <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. promiſeth to all the regenerate, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible inheritance, incontami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and not decaying, being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Heauen. To conclude <hi>S. Iohn</hi> without any exception thus preacheth to all the iuſt: <hi>See (I pray) what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Charity the Father hath giuen vs, that we ſhould be named, and be the Sonnes of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>From all this then we gather that the Place of habitation of the Saints is a <hi>Houſe,</hi> and not only a <hi>Citty or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> in which houſe all are Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes, Sonnes and heyres of the great King, and all of them are beloued of God, as Sonnes, and of Chriſt as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; &amp; that they may by good right ſay with the Prophet: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. <hi>O how good and pleaſant a thing it is, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to dwell in one?</hi> For what greater conſolation and comfort can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to a man, then to conuerſe with innumerable Angels, with men of all degrees, eyther ſuperiour, equall, and inferiour to him, and he to be beloued of them all with moſt ſincere affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a brother, to be vſed as a brother, &amp; imbraced &amp; entertained as a brother?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> King of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> after he had built a Temple to our Lord, with ſuch coſt and charges, as was fitting,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14091:93"/> did make a Pallace for himſelfe with ſuch profuſe coſt, as that he ſpent thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares in the building of it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had many Maiſters and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeers of the whole Fabricke, and had (at hand, with ſmall labour) great ſtore of precious and curious marble, and other ſtones, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cedar-trees. And not with leſſe charge and magnificence did he erect a Pallace for his vvife, being the daughter of the King of Egypt, ſo ſumptuous, as it ſeemed incredible. Therefore when the Sacred Scripture calleth that Habitation, the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> which in other paſſages therof, it calleth the <hi>Citty of God,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> it ſeemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that all that Citty, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is as reſplendent and glorious, as any Regall houſe or Pallace. For as we haue learned aboue, out of the Prophet <hi>Baruch;</hi> the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> is of that largeneſſe and extenſion, as that it is able to comprepend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the whole <hi>Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemed (a little aboue) a thing worthy of admiration, if any whole Kingdome ſhould appeare to be of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14091:93"/> that ſplendour and fayreneſſe, with which its chiefe <hi>Citty</hi> is adorned: Who then will not reſt aſtoniſhed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Therefore with good reaſon did the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> burſt forth into thoſe words: <hi>Pſal,</hi> 83. <hi>My ſoule euen coueteth, and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto the Courts of our Lord.</hi> For who doth not thirſtingly deſire to ſee and poſſeſſe a moſt noble Kingly houſe, which in its ſpacious greatneſſe may equall any Kingdome? As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to ſee and enioy a moſt ample and large <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſplendour, and magnificence may contend and compare with any Princely houſe or Pallace? Neither would our ſoule only deſire the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a <hi>Houſe</hi> &amp; ſuch a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> if attentiuely it did thinke thereof, and confidently belieue the ſame; but it would be wholy abſorpt, and euen faint, and tranſgreſſe its owne limits through the incredible beauty, and worth of ſo great a matter.</p>
               <p>But (alas) we, who lie vpon the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14091:94"/> ground, and are become thrall to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities and earthly things, and doe admire ſo much what we here ſee, doe little buſy our thoughts with inuiſible matters; we bearing our ſelues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, like to little children, who neuer going out of their Fathers houſe, doe ſo loue that poore Cottage, as that they neuer once thinke of the Pallaces of Kings. In like ſort, we imitate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Countrey-peſants, who neuer ſaw any Citty, but are buſied in tilling their ground, and in repayring their poore wodden, and clayie houſe; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinking on Pallaces, Towers, Theaters, Honours, dignities, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſiluer, chargeable banquets, and the like. And perhapps theſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks and Children are more happy, then many rich Cittizens, and great Princes; becauſe thoſe things which are in this world much prized and highly eſteemed, are commonly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on with more anxiety, care, and danger, then with ſolid profit and dignity.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14091:95"/> For thus doth our Lord himſelf ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſeruants, whome when our Lord commeth, he ſhal find watching: Verily I ſay vnto you, that he will gird himſelfe, and make them ſit downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will come forth, &amp; miniſter vnto them.</hi> What kind of ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

O, if we would ſeriouſly take theſe things into our conſideration, how loathing and cloying would all earthly pleaſures ſeeme vnto vs?</p>
               <p>Our Lord did ſometime gird him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a towel, that he might waſh his Diſciples feete. <hi>Peter</hi> was affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this ſight, and could not endure that his feete ſhould be waſhed by his Lord.

Therefore that girding of our Lord doth ſignify, that he ſhall ſo freely, ſo readily, and without any delay be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to euery one of his Seruants and Brethren; euen heaping vpon them all goodneſſe, as if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployment remayning for him, but only this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is a great felicity, and peculiar only to the Bleſſed For in this life there is no man wholy disburdened of all labour; and euen thoſe men, who ſeeme moſt to be at reſt and quietnes (to wit, noble and rich men) are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preſſed with greater anxieties. And therefore not without cauſe did our Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare Riches vnto Thornes in the Parable of the Sower: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. And <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>The life of man is a warfare vpon the Earth.</hi> And one of his fellowes conſpiringly thus auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5. <hi>A man is borne to labour, and a bird to flye.</hi> But <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> more copiouſly doth inlarge himſelfe vpon this point, thus preaching: <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Great trauell is created to all men, and a heauy yoke vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Adam, from the day of their comming forth of their Mothers wombe, vntill the day of their burying into the mother of all. Their Cogitations and feares of the Heart, imagination of things to come, and the day of their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from him that ſitteth vpon the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Seate, vnto him that is humbled
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14091:98"/> in earth and aſhes; from him, that weareth Hyacinth, and the Diademe, euen to him that is couered with rude ſackcloth.</hi> Thus <hi>Eccleſiasticus.</hi> In which words he teacheth vs, that no mortall man is at any time made entirely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Reſt.</p>
               <p>But to the end, that all men may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, of what worth and moment the <hi>ſleep,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſweet Repoſe</hi> of the Saints, is to be reſpected, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will (as it were) lay open the ſeuerall points of the former ſentence. Firſt then he ſaith: <hi>Great trauell is created to all men, and an heauy yoke vpon the children of Adam.</hi> Here oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation &amp; buſines is oppoſed to reſt; But becauſe many are buſied in things comfortable and pleaſant, as in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, playing, ſinging, and the like; therefore <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> addeth, <hi>an heauy yoke;</hi> thereby to ſhew, that he ſpeaketh of a labourſome, vnpleaſant, and toyleſome occupation, with which no man is delighted, and which All <hi>endeauour</hi> to decline and auoid. And this moſt troubleſome occupation, or negotiation he affirmeth to be created for men; that is, adioyned and aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to man, euen from his Creation,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14091:98"/> as an indiuiduall and inſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, Which point he further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicateth (that men may better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his meaning) by adioyning theſe words, <hi>From the day of their comming forth of their mothers wombe, vntill the day of their burying into the mother of all.</hi> Therefore a more mild and gentill courſe is taken with Oxen, which beare the yoke in the day-time, and reſt in the night, then with men, who both day and night are forced to beare the yoke of labour, and ſollicitude. And after this, <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> briefly toucheth vpon particular troubleſome moleſtitions, which like vnto a moſt heauy yoke, doe preſſe and bow down euen the necks of mortall men, ſaying: <hi>Their cogitations, and feares of the hart, imagination of things to come, and the day of their ending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that the firſt part or <hi>Scene</hi> of their laborious and painefull trauell, is a cogitation of thinges to come. For a worldly man is euer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and carefull of the day to come, ſaying to himſelfe: <hi>VVhat ſhall heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fall out? Shall we loſe the ſmal good which we now enioy?</hi> And from this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a continuall feare of the Hart,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14091:99"/> which neuer ſuffereth a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and quiet. Now this intenſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation is two-fold. For one part is that, which the mynd frames and figures out to it ſelf. The other is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſuch as no man can auoyd. Of the firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Imagination of things to come;</hi> of the other, <hi>the day of their Ending.</hi> A man doth imagine, that is, he doth frame to himſelfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers expectations of future things and perils, which do no leſſe torment him, then if it were certaine they ſhould come to paſſe, and take effect. But the greateſt torment to man, is the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and feare of death, which <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> aboue calleth, <hi>the day of mans ending;</hi> the which day all men haue in ſo great an a horrour, as that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. calleth it a <hi>continuall ſeruitude:</hi> ſince the ineuitable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of death doth make better, and (as it were) put wormewood, into all the ſweetneſſe and delicacies of this life.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> addeth, that this laborious occupation and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is ſo common to all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as that euery one of them from the firſt to the laſt (euen from him,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14091:99"/> who ſits enthroned in the Chayre of Soueraignty, and weareth the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme, and Hyacinth, to the poore &amp; deſpicable man, who liueth vpon the ground, and weareth ſackcloth) is made thrall thereto. Thus in all theſe things men after the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> are made more vnhappy then beaſts. For beaſts liue without feare; are not ſollicitous and forecaſting for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; neither doe they remember the labour once paſſed; neither are they affrighted with expectation of things to come. And therefore the foreſaid wiſe <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> doth heere teach, that this burdenſome yoke is layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sonnes as <hi>Adan;</hi> partly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude beaſts, as exempted from this yoke; and partly to ſhew the cauſe of this miſery; which is, the firſt ſinne of the firſt Man.</p>
               <p>But this is the height of all miſery, to thoſe who labour, and couer not to aſcend to the <hi>Celeſtiall Houſe</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; to wit, that in this life they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a grieuous yoake, but a farre mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14091:100"/> this life in Hell, all labour and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is without any comfort or repoſe: Only in the bleſſed <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> Reſt is without any labour, and conſolation without any dolour. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. iuſtly pronounceth; <hi>The Saints ſhall reioyce in glory, they ſhalbe ioyfull in their beddes.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not reſt, as men ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, who do not feele or perceaue their reſt; but they ſhal reſt with great exultation and ioy: well knowing and acknowledging with an eternall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude the good of their moſt happy reſt and quietnes; it being moſt free from all labour, griefe, feare, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation. Certainly if no other good were in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of our Lord, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this euerlaſting <hi>Rest,</hi> were it not (thinke you) worthy to ouer-balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; weigh downe all the labours, paines, and dolours of this life? And if in Hell there were no other torment, then an euerlaſting and vnquiet watching, did it not deſerue to be redeemed with all daily and nighly Prayers, &amp; other pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance whatſoeuer?</p>
               <p>O how pleaſant and gratefull will it appeare to the Saints, at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the world, to behould an
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14091:100"/> end of their labours, and other their paines; and on the other ſyde, how bitter will it be to the wicked, at their lyke leauing this world, to ſee, that neuer after they are in hope for any relaxation or eaſe of their labours, and dolours? <hi>Death</hi> is ſaid to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and laſt of all terrible things; yet becauſe <hi>death</hi> ſeemeth to haue ſome reſpiration or reſt from paines, there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore thoſe miſerable wretches, who ſhall deſcend into Hell, <hi>ſhall ſeeke for death, and ſhall not find it, &amp; they ſhall deſire to dye, and death ſhall fly from them.

               <p>But let vs explicate, from whence it proceedeth, that the Gate of ſo ample and great a houſe, is ſtrait. Well then, a <hi>Gate</hi> conſiſteth of foure parts; That is, of the Threeſhould, the Tranſome ouer the dore, and two ſide-ſtones; thus a Gate conſiſteth of foure ſtones; One below, another aboue, and two on the ſides. Theſe foure ſtones in this

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> of himſelfe, whoſe words I thinke good here to ſet downe. Thus then he writeth <hi>in ſerm. de com. vita Clerico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ab ijs, qui diligunt ſaeculum, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregaui me &amp;c. I haue ſeparated my ſelfe from thoſe, who loue the World; and with thoſe, who haue a preſidency and charge ouer the common People, I haue not equalled me. Neither in distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the banquet of our Lord haue I choſen any high place, but that which is inferiour and abiect. And it pleaſed our Lord to ſay to me: Aſcend aboue: I did much feare to vndergoe an Epiſcopall ſtate, after my name did once begin to ſpread it ſelfe: I did decline that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as much as I could, to the end, that my poore ſoule might be ſaued in a low and humble place, and not indangered in a high place. But as I ſaid, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14091:116"/> ought not to withstand or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Lord and Maiſter.</hi> Thus this Holy Father. And I would to God, all men vvould be emulous of <hi>S. Austin</hi> herein; for then we ſhould haue many good Prelates, many good Princes, many good Magiſtrates. But becauſe there are many, who thruſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vp into high places, and do not vouchſafe to expect the calling of our Lord thereto, therefore God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offended thereat, and for the example of others, he forceth many of them to ſit in the loweſt place; to the end, that all may vnderſtand and confeſſe, that honours, riches (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall and ſpirituall goods) do depend vpon the diſtribution of Gods hand. And hence it is, that we often ſee, men moſt rich, in a ſhort tyme, to be brought to the extremity of all want and penury; and great Princes to be dethroned, and caſt out of their ſeates of Maieſty.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſufficient only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the calling of God, but a man ought to beare himſelfe in his Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Principality without any pride or elation of mind; but according to the counſell of the <hi>Wiſeman Eccl.</hi> 3. <hi>by

Now with God he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who is better; and he is better, who more excelleth in Vertue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Gouerment, riches, titles, crownes, or diademes; Since they are Vertues (not Prelacy, Riches, Honours, and the like) which make a man good. And if <hi>Vertues</hi> do make man <hi>good;</hi> then the greater <hi>Vertues</hi> he hath, make him better; and the moſt <hi>Vertues</hi> make him beſt; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they who are inueſted with Vertues in a more high degree, do the more excell others. Now that <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is one of theſe Great and prime Vertues, appeareth, from that our Lord giueth exaltation and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Humility,</hi> in that (ſo often

               <p>NOw, what ſhall we ſpeake of <hi>Charity?</hi> This Vertue, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the difficulty of fulfilling its precepts, is of a moſt narrow and ſtrayt extent; ſo in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the <hi>Diuine Goodnes</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <hi>Charity</hi> hath reference) it may be ſaid to be of a moſt great breadth. For why ought it to ſeeme hard, to <hi>loue God with all our Hart, with all our
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14091:124"/> ſoule, with all our strength,</hi> when as he is moſt ſayre, moſt good, &amp; moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy of infinite Loue? It is not a hard matter here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Earth, to loue things that are fayre and good; but it is hard not to loue them at all, or not to loue them too much. Therefore God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (after a certaine manner) to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs wrong, in commanding, vnder ſo ſeuere puniſhments to loue him, as if of our owne accord and willingly we ought not to loue him. But ſome may reply, ſaying: Thoſe things, which are good, &amp; fayre here vpon the Earth, are ſo ardently loued, and affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are clearely ſeene, as being ſubiect to the ſenſe; <hi>But God no man euer ſaw. Ioan.</hi> 1. It is true indeed, we ſee not God; neuertheleſſe we haue ſeene, and do dayly ſee his workes, which are very fayre: of which works the <hi>VViſeman</hi> thus ſayth, <hi>Sap.</hi> 13. <hi>Yf with whoſe beauty being delighted</hi> (meaning with the <hi>beauty of the Sunne and the Moone) they thought them Gods let them know, how much the Lord of them, is more beautifull then they; for the Authour of Beauty made all thoſe things.</hi> We in like ſort do make triall and taſt of the ſweetnes of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:14091:124"/> in his daily Benefits conferred vpon vs. To conclude, we haue the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him, who ſayth, and cannot lye; to wit, of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth by the Apoſtles and Prophets in the Holy Scriptures, that <hi>God</hi> is ſo good, and ſo fayre, as that He alone deſerueth to be ſtyled <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Fayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here ſome will inſiſt, and ſay, It is very hard, and euen incompatible with our Nature, to be forced (for <hi>Gods</hi> ſake) to loſe our ſubſtance and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, our neareſt friends, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our owne liues. I confeſſe, that this is hard to men not louing <hi>God;</hi> but to ſuch, as do loue him; and couet to enioy him, ſay it is light and eaſy; eſpecially ſeing in recompence of our contempt of theſe tempora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l goods, there are prepared for vs, goods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably far more in number, and better. O! obſerue the diſparity. Thou loſeſt corruptible and fading riches; thou ſhalt gaine an euerlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thou loſeſt Father, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and friends; thou ſhalt gaine <hi>God</hi> to be thy Father, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> thy Brother, and all the Angells &amp; Saints thy friends and Companions. Thou
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14091:125"/> loſeſt a <hi>temporall life,</hi> euen ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with miſery; thou ſhalt gaine an <hi>eternall life,</hi> fraught with all felicity. Heare then this Canticle or ſong of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue: <hi>Yf a man ſhall giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe for loue, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall he deſpiſe it. Cant.</hi> 8. And a litle afore: <hi>Many VVaters</hi> (meaning of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Charity, neither ſhall flouds ouerwhelme it.</hi> Heare a ſo one of thoſe, who loued God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Who then ſhall ſeparate vs from the Charity of Chriſt? tribulation? or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe? or famine? or nakednes? or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? or perſecution? or the ſword? But in all theſe we ouercome, becauſe of him that hath loued vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome do yet further vrge: So to loue my neighbour, as to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and impart my goods to him, yea though he were my deadly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and had much iniured me, ſo as I ought not only to pardon him, but to heape benefits vpon him; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be very harſh and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Humane Nature. This perhaps may be truly ſaid, being ſpoken of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Nature, as it is corrupted by ſinne; but not of Nature repayred through the Grace of Chriſt. Doth not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14091:125"/> communicate his goods and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, euen to his Enemies? And doth he not duly pardon his enemies, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to them by way of a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Good for Bad, whiles he <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſunne to ſhyne vpon the good &amp; the euill, and rayneth vpon the Iuſt &amp; Vniuſt? Matth.</hi> 5. Now if God do ſo beare himſelfe towards his Enemies; it then followeth, that it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary either to the Nature <hi>of God,</hi> or of man (who is created to the Image of God) to loue our Enemies, or to do them benefits; but it is only contrary to the nature of Beaſts, and of thoſe men, who, when they were in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, did not vnderſtand: they were compared to Beaſts without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; became like to them. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN this laſt place I come to <hi>Humility,</hi> which is like to its Siſters, the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14091:126"/> which Vertue, as it begetteth great ſtraits to the proud and arrogant, ſo with eaſe it beginneth to be dilated and made larger, to ſuch who wilbe taught in the Schoole of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For firſt, we ought to humble our ſelfes <hi>vnder the potent hand of God,</hi> as the Chiefe of the Apoſtles hath admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vs, 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 5. and as his Coapoſtle <hi>S. Iames</hi> confirmeth, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. Now what difficulty can be imagined, to be in the humiliation of a mortall man, to the immortall and Omnipotent God? Furthermore, we ought alſo to make choiſe of the loweſt place among men, as preſuming them to be better then our ſelues are, as the Apoſtle counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, ſaying, <hi>Philip</hi> 2. <hi>Ech one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others better then himſelfe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who know themſelues, and are priuy to their owne imperfections, but knovv not what ſecret Vertue may lye hid in the breaſt of others, do ſuffer no difficulty to repute others ſuperiour to themſelues, and do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly honour them, and giue to them the higher and more worthy place. For as Pryde groweth from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a man no knowing himſelfe, ſo <hi>Humility</hi> from the true knowing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14091:126"/> of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>A proude Hart quickly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the Vices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which it ſelfe hath not, but which others haue, becauſe all theſe are out of him: yet his proper Vices, though often far greater and knowne to all other men, this man ſeeth not, becauſe they are within him: Euen as the Eye, which ſeeth not what is within it ſelfe, but only what is without it. The <hi>Phariſy Luc,</hi> 18. may be an example hereof to vs, who gaue thanks to <hi>God,</hi> that he was not, as other men were, to wit, <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Iniust; Adulterers;</hi> for he did ſee, that the Vices of <hi>Rapine, Iniustice, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi> were not in him; but he did not ſee the more grieuous Vices vvhich did lye lurking within him, I meane, <hi>Pryde, blindnes of mind, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency;</hi> and therefore he preferred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before the <hi>Publican,</hi> praying in the ſame Temple. But the <hi>Publican,</hi> who was of a more cleare ſight, did ſee the Vices in himſelfe, but not the Vertues; and therefore he tooke the lovveſt place, ſtanding a far off, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his breaſt, and imploring the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God: And ſo the euent was, that by the iudgment of <hi>God,</hi> this poore
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14091:127"/> humbled man departed iuſtified, that other, reprobated. Wherefore if a man (voyding his iudgment of all ſelfeloue) vvill labour diligently to knovv his ovvne imbecillity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, he vvill not ſuffer any ſtraits, in entring into the Gate of the hovvſe of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all theſe precedent diſcourſes, it is needfull to adioyne this one Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That vvheras the <hi>Port</hi> or <hi>Gate</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>God</hi> ſeemeth moſt narrovv, and almoſt impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe vvho come to is heauily burdened and loaden, or vvho are of a groſſe and corpulent body, or cloathed vvith many garments, or labour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therin, lifting themſelues vp in their full height and ſtature; So is the ſame <hi>Gate</hi> become large, and eaſy for entrance to thoſe, vvho come vnto it, without burden, naked, leane, and crooked, or bending themſelues: and therefore the fault is in vs, why vve may not eaſily enter by that <hi>Gate,</hi> through the vvhich many Saints vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty, and trouble haue already paſſed.</p>
               <p>Therefore let a Chriſtian man lay dovvne the burden of his Riches: Let
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14091:127"/> him knovv, that riches are giuen by <hi>God</hi> to him, to be a Diſpenſer, and not an abſolute Lord therof, that ſo he do diſtribute them to the needy &amp; poore, and not reſerue them to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. And then it ſhall to fall out, that his mind being free from the loue of riches, and he lightned of the great burden thereof, ſhall fynd the <hi>Gate</hi> wyde inough for his entrance; In like ſort, let him free, and deliuer himſelfe of that ouermuch fatnes (as I may terme it) of carnall delights; or rather let him caſt out the hurtfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Humour of ſeuerall Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences; which engender a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>Dropſy,</hi> and puffe vp the Body. To conclude, let him diſueſt himſelfe of all proper eſtimation and ſelfe loue; let him put on the <hi>Humility</hi> of Chriſt, let him incline and bend his necke to the obedience of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and then let him complayne (if he can) if with all conuenient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and eaſe, he cannot paſſe through the Gate of Saluation.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14091:132"/> Lambe.</hi> Certainly the Scripture by the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of a ſupper, ſignifieth dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and pleaſure; except we will maintayne, that in the ſenſe of <hi>Taſting</hi> there is no pleaſure. And we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex hereto, that in the Goſpell, and in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is compared to a <hi>Regall or Princely Supper;</hi> as is euident out of that King, <hi>VVho made a mariage for his ſonne;</hi> and out of the Parable <hi>of the Wiſe &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins;</hi> of which, the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> did enter with the Bridegroome to the Mariage, but the <hi>Fooliſh</hi> Virgins were ſhut out. We alſo fynd in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> many things to be ſpoken of the Mariage of the Lambe in the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> being celebrated with all magnificent preparation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the felicity of the Saints is compared to Princely Mariages, at what tyme all kind of pleaſures almoſt are enioyed; of which point we are further to diſcourſe in the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Booke.</p>
               <p>To conclude. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi> did ſee a Company of Virgins, who did follow the Lambe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he went, and did ſing a new ſong which no others could ſing:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14091:133"/> Which place <hi>S. Austin</hi> expoundeth of certaine holy ioyes and pleaſures, which the Virgins (either men, or Women) do enioy. His words are theſe: <hi>You ſhall bring to the Mariage of the Lambe a new ſong, which you ſhall ſing vpon your Citherns: that is, you ſhall ſing prayſes in your Harts; not ſuch as the whole Earth ſingeth, but ſuch, as not any can ſing but your ſelues. Aug. de ſancta Virgin. c.</hi> 27. And then after: <hi>Whither may we thinke this Lambe will goe? Where none ſhalbe able, or dare to follow him but your ſelues? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we thinke him to goe, into what gardens or other pleaſant places? Thither I belieue, where the graſſe is ioyes, not the vayne ioyes of this VVorld being but lying Madnes; neither the ioyes, which are graunted in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to others not being Virgins; but they are ioyes, diſtinguiſhed from all other kind of ioyes.</hi> And then againe a little after: <hi>The rest of the multitude of the faithfull ſhall ſee you, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow this Lambe; They ſhall ſee, but the ſhall not enjoy; and reioycing with you that which they haue not in themſelues, they ſhall haue in you; for they ſhall not be able to ſing that new
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14091:133"/> ſong peculiar to you, but they ſhalbe able to heare it, and to be delighted in your great delight. But you, who ſhall both ſing and heare this new ſong, becauſe in that you ſhall ſing it, you ſhall heare it, you ſhall with more felicity exult or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and with more pleaſure reigne. ibid. c.</hi> 29.

               <p>But to proceed, and that we may proue the truth of this point by force
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14091:135"/> of Reaſon. We are to learne out of S. <hi>Thomas (p.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 31. <hi>a.</hi> 5.) that delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is taken from knowledg, requireth three things; to wit, an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent</hi> or <hi>ſentient Power;</hi> an <hi>Obiect,</hi> ſorting to that <hi>Power;</hi> and an <hi>Vnion of the Obiect with that Power.</hi> Now by how much the <hi>power</hi> is more apt to know, and the <hi>Obiect</hi> more noble, and the <hi>Vnion</hi> more intrinſecall &amp; inward; by ſo much the delectation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence proceeding, is greater. That the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> or the <hi>mynd</hi> is more pure, more high, more noble, and more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as I may ſay) and therein more apt for knowledge, then the externall ſenſe, is ſo euident, as it needeth no proofe. Now that <hi>God</hi> is a more high, and more noble <hi>Obiect,</hi> not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <hi>all the Obiects</hi> of the Senſes, but euen aboue all the <hi>Obiects</hi> of the ſoule or mind (ſince he is an Infinite <hi>Good, all good, or rather Goodnes it ſelf</hi>) no man can doubt. That the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the Intelligence, by an open &amp; cleare Viſion, is an <hi>Vnion</hi> ſo inward, as that the Eſſence of God doth penetrate the vvhole mind of the ſeer, and the mind is euen tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed into <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, as into a great ſea, is likewiſe certaine.</p>

               <p>Who therefore is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or coniecture, how great that <hi>Ioy</hi> is, or what kind of kiſſe is that of the ſupreme good, or what imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it of a Spouſe of an infinite Beauty? Certainly in the coniunction of a fayre Colour with the ſenſe of ſeeing, or of a ſweete ſound with the ſenſe of Hearing (and the like is to be ſaid of other ſenſible <hi>Obiects,</hi> with their ſenſes) we receaue great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and often ſo great, as that diuers men by this meanes do almoſt become madd; Neuertheleſſe the Powers of the ſenſes are materiall, and common to vs with Beaſts: And the <hi>Obiects</hi> of them, are things Corporall, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes do no leſſe hurt, then delight &amp; pleaſe.

VVe may add hereto, that ſpirituall Vnion, and the Vnion of <hi>God</hi> with the Intelligence or mind by Viſion, is more firme, more durable, and altogether entyre; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as corporall delectations, which are taken by the ſenſes, becauſe they are ſubiect to change, they cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

               <p>Now <hi>(O Man)</hi> gather thy ſelfe togeather, and weigh in a true bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and with a ſteedy hand, the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> which the <hi>VVorld</hi> proſtituteth and offereth to thee, with that <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> doth promiſe, when he promiſeth the ſight &amp; Viſion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to thoſe that loue him; And then in this thy ballancing make choyce of that <hi>pleaſure</hi> thou moſt doeſt couet.

               <p>But neither the only <hi>Viſion of God</hi> is promiſed to holy men in Heauen, but alſo the Viſion and ſight of all things, which God hath made. Heere vpon the Earth we behould by the ſenſe of our ſight, the Sunne, the

               <p>BEſides that <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> vvhich the <hi>Will</hi> taketh from the good of the Vnderſtanding, there are three things, vvhich ſhall properly beget and cauſe <hi>Ioy</hi> in the <hi>VVill</hi> it ſelfe. One of theſe is, a moſt ardent <hi>Loue of God,</hi> and of our Neighbour: For <hi>Loue</hi> is a principall ſauce, or ſeaſoning of all things that are to be beloued. He that loueth, iudgeth all thoſe things which he loueth, to be moſt fayre and good; and therefore he much reioyceth at the preſence and ſight of them: As contrary-wiſe at their abſence he greatly lamenteth. We ſee that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who out of a naturall affection loue their Children dearely, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that they are moſt fayre, moſt witty, and moſt wyſe; although often they be deformed, and but ſhallow-witted; &amp; if choyce were giuen them, they vvould not change them for any others, though in an impartiall Eye far better and fayrer. In like ſort, we ſee, that men either through VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14091:138"/> or ſome vnexpected accident, are taken and ſurprized with the Loue of deformed perſons; houlding it a moſt pleaſant thing to conuerſe with them; and moſt infortunate to be ſeparated from their company and familiariry. Which proceeding only <hi>Loue</hi> cauſeth, being (as aboue we ſaid) a ſauce to all things, which are the ſubiect of Loue.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing theſe thinges ſtand thus, what, and how ineffable ſhall the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the Saints be, euer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with <hi>God,</hi> and all the Bleſſed whom they ſhall moſt ardently loue; who are truly moſt fayre and moſt good, euen in a cleare and vnpartiall iudgment, and from whom they ſhall know, that they are neuer to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated? As on the contrary, it ſhalbe one of the greateſt puniſhments of Hell, to be forced euer to be in the Company of thoſe damned ſpirits, whom they extremely hate, and by whoſe diuers ſtratagems and deuiſes they know, themſelues to haue beene circumuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abuſed.</p>
               <p>An other <hi>Conſideration,</hi> which ſhal much increaſe the <hi>ioy</hi> of the Bleſſed in the <hi>will,</hi> ſhalbe an vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14091:139"/> reſt, and ſatiety without cloying, vvhich ſhall make them on all ſydes ſatisfyed and content. Heere vpon Earth no man liues contented with his ſtate; There is no man, but he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth many things which he cannot obtaine. And hence it riſeth, that there are ſo many hungry and thirſty men in the purſuit of temporall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in the VVorld. Neither is this to be much wondred at; ſince our mind is capable of an infinite and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Good; wheras the things created are ſmall in themſelues, of a fading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cannot long continue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what exultation and ioy ſhall it be to that man, who ſhall ſee himſelfe ſeated in that place, where he ſhall liue in all contentment and ſweete repoſe of mind; vvhere nothing ſhalbe wanting, nothing ſhall affright him, nothing ſhalbe deſired, nothing more ſhalbe ſought after? O Peace ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all apprehenſion of ſenſe, the which the VVorld cannot affoard, and vvhich is found only in the heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the City of the peacefull &amp; moſt great King.

               <p>The <hi>third thing,</hi> which ſhall bring great <hi>Ioy to a Bleſſed VVill,</hi> is <hi>Iuſtice;</hi> and this perfect, and more perfect, then was the Originall Iuſtice in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> The <hi>Iustice</hi> of him did ſubiect the inferiour part of the ſoule to the ſuperiour, as long as the ſuperiour was ſubiect to <hi>God:</hi> But this Iuſtice ſubiecteth the inferiour part to the ſuperiour, and the ſuperiour to <hi>God,</hi> by a moſt firme and indiſſoluble band and connexion: That was (as it were) a wollen or linnen Garment, this a ſilken, or goulden Veſtment which maketh the VVill moſt fayre &amp; amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, to the Angells, &amp; all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules.

               </p>
               <p>Of theſe foure qualities, or priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a glorified Body, that of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or ſplendour belongeth to the ſenſe of <hi>Seeing,</hi> as aboue we haue ſaid; the other three ſeeme properly to belong to the ſenſe of <hi>Touching.</hi> For euen as, when the Body is oppreſſed with ſtrokes, diſeaſes, or wounds endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life, the Senſe of <hi>Touching</hi> is that, which ſuffereth and grieueth; ſo in like manner, when the Body en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth perfect health, is ſound, and of a ſtrong conſtitution, the <hi>Senſe of Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> doth reioyce. Therefore this ſenſe ſhall haue great <hi>ioy</hi> in Heauen, vvhen after the Reſurrection it ſhalbe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14091:149"/> clad with Immortality, Impaſsibility, and Health in the higheſt degree, and this for all Eternity. What charges would not men willingly be at (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Princes, and others of great eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) to be freed all their life time, from the dolours of the Goute, or of the Heade, the ſtomack, or the reynes? What ioy ſhall it then be in Heauen, from whence not only death, but all diſeaſes and griefs ſhalbe altogeather exiled? Furthermore, thoſe Qualities, through the which a corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth riſe incorruptible, and a body that is infirme, riſeth impaſſible, do belong to the ioy of the <hi>Senſe of Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like ſort, the qualities of Agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Subtility, by which a <hi>Naturall</hi> Body ſhall riſe <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> ſeeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſame <hi>Senſe of touching:</hi> ſince that Body ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14091:149"/> to penetrate and pierce all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and this in ſuch ſort, as if it were not a Body, but a ſpirit. Therefore euen as the <hi>Senſe of Touching</hi> grieueth and beareth it ſelfe not well, when a heauy and weighty body is forced to aſcend high, or with great ſwiftnes &amp; ſpeed to be remoued from place to place; ſo alſo on the contrary, it much reioyceth and exulteth, when a Body without any toyle, or wearines, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcendeth aboue, or paſſeth moſt ſpeedily from place to place.</p>
               <p>Behould therefore from what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of Corruption the Bleſſed ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be freed, when as they ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> which ought to be ſo much the more high, and ſo much the more good, by how much the perſons for which it is ordayned, are better?

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14091:156"/> and of all other lyke moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py men, could be obtained without labour, and retained and kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare; as alſo if we further ſuppoſe ſuch moſt fortunate men neuer to ſin, nor neuet to dye; yet ſo, as that they might ſinne, and might dye: Now all this by ſuppoſall being granted, I moſt confidently affirme, that the goods of the <hi>Celeſtiall Paradiſe</hi> only, do infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpaſſe all the goods of this world, and of the <hi>Terrestriall Paradiſe</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, From whence it will appeare, that thoſe goods being ioyned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither ſatisfy the mynd; nor ſatiate the deſire of the mynd; ſince the Hart of Man is capable of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit and boundleſſe good. Therefore that ſhall euer ſtand for a true &amp; maine Poſition, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath left recorded <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Confeſſ. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Thou haſt O Lord made vs for thy ſelf, and to the lykenes of thy ſelfe; yet our Hart is vnquiet, till it reſt in thy ſclfe,</hi> And ſo true alſo is that, which the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>I ſhall be filled, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy glory ſhall appeare.</hi> Now ſo long as the Hart ſhalbe vnquiet, it ſhalbe miſerable; and if it be miſerable, ſo long it cannot be bleſſed or happy.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:14091:156"/>
               <p>But the <hi>Celeſtiall Paradiſe</hi> enioyeth this priuiledg, that, it is of power to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the ſoule, and to exile and expell all vnquietneſſe and ſolicitude. For what can that man want, who ſhalbe lyke to God, <hi>Becauſe he ſhall ſee God, as he is,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.? What can he wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whome God <hi>ſhall conſtitute or appoint ouer all goods. Matth.</hi> 24.? What can he want, who ſhall reigne with God, <hi>ſhalbe coheyre with Chriſt, whome the Father hath appointed heyre of all. Heb.</hi> 1.? I ſay, what can this man want, except he will dreame, that <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is miſerable? Furthermore, thoſe goods of the world, and of the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Paradiſe</hi> (how great, or of what Nature ſoeuer they might be) in that they ſtood obnoxious to be loſt, were not perfect goods; neither could they ſatiate the mynd, or giue to it a full repoſe, or reſt; and for this reſpect they did not, nor could make a Man Bleſſed or happy: but the goods of the <hi>Celeſtiall Paradiſe</hi> are on euery ſyde perfect &amp; ſtable; neyther are they in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort ſubiect to loſſe, or dimunition: for the Saints placed in thoſe moſt happy Seates, can neither dye, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ſinne; and of their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14091:157"/> felicity they are moſt ſecure. Therefore let mortall men open their eyes, let them often call to mynd, of what moment it is, not to looſe the <hi>Celestiall Paradiſe.</hi> For heare the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe toucheth the maine matter of all others, and is not about trifles, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vanities, And therefore the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>God,</hi> euen through a diuine Iudgement, hath pronounced: <hi>VVhat doth it profit a man, if he gaine the whole VVorld, and ſuſtaine the domage of his ſoule?

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14091:157"/> from vs, not that himſelfe might enioy it, but only that we might be depriued of it. For to this end the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſeduced <hi>Eue,</hi> and by her he cauſed <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, that ſo they might be Conſorts and fellowes in puniſhment. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore is that prudent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.) <hi>who gaue all his goods, that he might buy this precious Margarite;</hi> by the which he clearely inough did teach, that the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> is ſignified: for it is he, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſayth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>You are brought with a great Pryce.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>S. Peter: Not with corruptible things, gould, or ſiluer are you redeemed, but with the precious bloud</hi> (as it were) <hi>of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate and vnſpotted Lambe, Christ,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. And againe; <hi>They deny him, that bought them, the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> (at one and the ſame tyme) did buy <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for vs, and did buy vs. For we before were made Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and had loſt <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by ſinne: But <hi>Chriſt</hi> redeeming vs from ſinne, and from the Captiuity of the Deuill, did withall adopt vs the <hi>Sonnes, and heyres of God;</hi> and in ſo doing, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Paradiſe</hi> vnto vs. From hence
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14091:158"/> therefore the greatnes and vvorth of the <hi>Celeſtiall Paradiſe</hi> may be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; to wit, that in the Wiſdome of God, it is thought to be vvorthy of an infinite Pryce.</p>
               <p>If heere among men a prudent &amp; rich merchant ſhould be content to giue all his vvealth for the buying of a precious Pearle; certainly no man vvould once doubt, but that the Ievvell vvere of ſo ineſtimable Worth and valew, as that it could hardly fynd a ſufficient pryce. Of what account and eſtimation then (if vve haue any ſparke of true iudgment) ought the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen</hi> ſeeme to vs to be, the vvhich the <hi>VViſdome of God,</hi> the <hi>VVord Incarnate,</hi> vvith all his labours, toyles, and dolours, for the ſpace of thirty three yeares, and laſtly vvith his owne bloud and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious death, did purchaſe, and buy? VVe are vvholy ſtupid, yea mad, if vve vvill ſell our intereſt and title of that thing, for a baſe and moſt vile price of temporall Good, vvhich <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord rated at an infinite Pryce and valevv.</p>
               <p>But vvhat? Not only <hi>Chriſt</hi> vvas content to buy <hi>Paradiſe</hi> with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14091:158"/> of his owne bloud; but all Saints being herein taught by him, did moſt willingly expoſe whatſoeuer they had, with all their force &amp; ſtrength, for the gayning of the ſaid <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Yea the Bleſſed Apoſtle thus burſteth out in words: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Paſsions of this tyme are not worthy of the glory to come, that shalbe reuealed to vs.</hi> And if any of the Martyrs were demanded, whether they did willingly buy <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> vvith ſuch Torments; as alſo if the Holy Confeſſours were queſtioned, whether they did in like ſort promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly and readily buy <hi>Paradiſe</hi> with their ſo many Watchings, Faſts, Prayers, Almes deedes, and Perſecutions; no doubt they would all cry out in one voyce with the Apoſtle: <hi>The Paſsions and ſufferings of this tyme, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the glory to come, which shalbe reuealed to vs.</hi> For although the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not only a worthy price of Paradiſe for vs, but alſo (as I may ſpeake) more then a worthy Pryce, as being ſupereminent, and exceeding the dignity of the thing which was bought; neuertheleſſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> good pleaſure was, that we alſo ſhould buy <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> thereby the more to honour
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14091:159"/> and exalt vs. The Glory of man is great, in that he obtayneth <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> not only from the merits of <hi>Christ;</hi> but alſo from his owne merits, ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Vertue and force of <hi>Christ</hi> his merits. And if a man will not (when it is in his povver) do good, and ſuffer euill, for the buying of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he is worthily expelled from the buying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as an euill and ſlouthfull ſeruant, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe admoniſheth in the Parable of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, Matth.</hi> 25. and the Apoſtle vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently counſelleth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. when he ſayth: <hi>Yf ſonnes, Heyres alſo; Heyres tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, and Coheyres of Chriſt; yet if we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to preuent, that whereas ſome men may perhaps complayne, they haue not a ſufficient <hi>Pryce</hi> for the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> let ſuch take notice, that nothing more is asked of vs here, but what our ſelues haue. For thus <hi>S.

And further, we are to obſerue, that the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> is ſometimes in the Parables deſcribed more obſcurely, at other tymes more clearely, and ſometimes not touched at all. I wil explicate the ſeuerall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this diuiſion.</p>
               <p>Whereas our Lord in <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> ſetteth downe the Parable <hi>of the ſower,</hi> he deſcribeth the fruite, which the Preaching of the Ghoſpell bringeth forth, according to the diuers diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14091:162"/> of the earth: and this he calleth the Miſtery of the <hi>Kingdome of God:</hi> but touching the Beatitude of the Saints he ſpeaketh nothing. But where our Lord in the ſame place, doth add the Parable of the Cockle, he briefly toucheth the felicity of Saints, when he ſayth, that the good Seede, or <hi>wheat</hi> is to be gathered vp into the barne of our Lord, and the <hi>Cockle</hi> to be tyed togeather and burned. But when in the ſame Chapter he relateth the Parables of him that ſought for good <hi>Pearles,</hi> and of him that did find the <hi>Treaſure hidden in the field,</hi> then more perſpicuouſly he compareth the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> to a Pearle, <hi>and to a Treaſure:</hi> And of this third kind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Parables of our Lord, I find only ſix. One of a <hi>Treaſure hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in a field;</hi> another of a precious <hi>Margarite or Pearle;</hi> The third of the <hi>daily Penny;</hi> the fourth <hi>of the Lord, or Mayſter distributing the Talents;</hi> The fift, of a <hi>Great ſupper;</hi> the ſixt of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> To the which we will adioyne two ſimilitudes out of the Apoſtle; the one of thoſe who <hi>runne in a race;</hi> the other, who <hi>fight,</hi> or ſtryue <hi>for the Maistery:</hi> So as there ſhalbe eight

               <p>The firſt <hi>Parable</hi> then is taken from <hi>S. Mathew: cap</hi> 13. <hi>The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is like to a Treaſure, hidden in a field.</hi> VVhere our Lord teacheth, how it may be gotten, when he ſayth: <hi>Which when a man hauing found, did hide it, and for ioy thereof goeth, and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Treaſure</hi> ſignifieth a great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of gould, ſiluer, and precious ſtones; as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Ciuill Lawyer teacheth <hi>(de acquir. rerum dom. L. Nunquam)</hi> &amp; this <hi>Treaſure</hi> ought to be ſo ancient, as that there remayned no memory therof before; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath no proper Lord, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth by right to him, that findeth it. <hi>This Treaſure</hi> in <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> is the <hi>Diuinity</hi> it ſelfe, which is hid in the field of the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Chriſt, as <hi>S. Hilarius</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome (in Com. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Matth.</hi>) do rightly expound. For in <hi>Christ</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſayth) <hi>all the Treaſures of the knowledge and VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God are hidden.</hi> Now the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</hi> is the moſt true <hi>Treaſure</hi> of all goods, and is indeed ſo ancient (ſince
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14091:163"/> it is eternall, and did precede all Ages) as that there can be no former memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it extant. Neither had this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Treaſure</hi> any proper Lord to own it, for it ſelfe is the Lord of all things. Neuertheleſſe this Treaſure of the <hi>Diuinity</hi> is ſaid to belong to the right of them that find it; becauſe <hi>God</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelfe freely to thoſe, who by ſelling all their ſubſtance and Goods, earneſtly labour to acquire &amp; purchaſe him.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid to be had, as it were, and digged in a field, to wit, in the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for although the <hi>Diuinity</hi> be euery where, yet it is in no place ſo properly and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the which it is ſo vnited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that one and the ſame Perſon is both <hi>God and Man.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle ſayth, 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 5. <hi>God was in Christ, reconciling the VVorld to himſelfe.</hi> And though the <hi>Diuinity</hi> be in no place more, then in the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſeemeth to be ſo hid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as that it is needfull to vſe a light or candle, to demonſtrate and ſhew God to be in Chriſt.

                  </gap>ligently ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Merchant. And truly in this place the Celeſtiall Beatitude, or Chriſt himſelfe is vnderſtood by the <hi>Pearle,</hi> as <hi>S. Ambroſe, ſerm.</hi> 6. <hi>S. Gregory
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14091:166"/> Nazianzen. orat.</hi> 49. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do interprete. That is called the <hi>Pearle</hi> in this Parable, which in the former Parable was called a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> to giue vs to vnderſtand, that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</hi> of Chriſt (which is the Obiect of Eternall felicity, or, the <hi>Viſion</hi> whereof (to ſpeake in the Deuines dialect) is the <hi>formall Beatitude</hi> or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, is indeed a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> but not deuided into ſeuerall kinds of gould, ſiluer, and precious ſtones; but is one thing, which contayneth in it ſelfe the price of an infinite <hi>Treaſure.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Pearle</hi> is but one only thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning in it ſelfe (according to the iudgment of <hi>Pliny) (lib</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 35.) the perfection and height of all Precious things.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, a <hi>Treaſure</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of only money or goods, though in very great quantity, which <hi>Treaſure</hi> reſpecteth only profit, &amp; not pleaſure, or outward Pompe. Wherefore to preuent, that a man do not gather out of the former Parable, that <hi>Celestiall Beatitude</hi> is only profitable, and not ſpecious and honourable, our Lord did adde this other Parable of the Pearle: in which he teacheth, that the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14091:167"/> Diuinity of Chriſt, and our felicity is lyke to the Pearle; which (beſides the profit of a <hi>Treaſure</hi>) hath alſo in it fayrenes and ſplendour which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne &amp; delight. We may adde heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that the <hi>Pearle</hi> is the Symbole, Character, or ſigne of Chriſt, both as he is the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> &amp; alſo as he is the Sonne <hi>of the Virgin.</hi> For as the <hi>Pearle</hi> is ingendred of the light of the Sunne, and of the dew of Heauen (as <hi>Pliny</hi> in the place aboue cited, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do teach) ſo alſo the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> according to his Deity, is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> who is an <hi>increated Sunne,</hi> and therefore it is ſaid in the Creed, <hi>Light of Light, True God of true God.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Christ</hi> according to his <hi>Humanity,</hi> is begotten of the dew <hi>of Heauen;</hi> becauſe he was conceaued of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and not of the ſeed of man. To conclude, the <hi>Pearle</hi> is whyte, cleare, ſolid, pure, light, and round; In like ſort the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt</hi> (much more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably his <hi>Diuinity</hi>) is <hi>whyte</hi> through its innocency, lucid or <hi>cleare,</hi> through its wiſdome, <hi>ſolid</hi> for its co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy, <hi>pure</hi> as being without ſpot, <hi>light</hi> in regard of its ſweetnes and mildnes, <hi>round</hi> in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14091:167"/> that it is of ech ſyde perfect.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Pearle</hi> in the Goſpell is not found by chance, but it is ſought after diligently by the prudent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. Neither doth this Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the former, in which the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is ſaid to be found by chance; for both theſe Points are true, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſons: And therefore our Lord euen out of a diuine prudence, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne this later Parable to the former, leſt it might be thought to happen to all men, to light vpon the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> vnexpectedly, and caſually. For <hi>God</hi> doth illuminate ſome men vpon a ſudden, with ſingular or ſpeciall grace; ſo as they neither ſeeking, nor coueting, nor thinking thereof, do notwithſtanding arriue to truth of Fayth, to a moſt ardent Charity, yea to a certaine hope of obtayning eternall lyfe. And theſe men may be ſaid to find this <hi>Treaſure</hi> by chance; although <hi>God,</hi> not by chance, but through his <hi>Eternall Prouidence,</hi> did preordayne them to this grace, and to future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now other men <hi>God</hi> doth indeed preuent with his Grace, but he doth not preſently ſhow to them the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> but as it were breaths into them a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14091:168"/> deſire of ſeeking the Truth, making them carefull Merchants, and helping and directing them, vntill they find the Precious <hi>Pearle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may glaſſe this different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S.

And when he was in his iourney, <hi>Breathing forth threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſlaughter, against the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Lord,</hi> Chriſt did appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and withall did blynd the eyes of his body, that he might illuminate the eyes of his hart; and this with ſo great a ſplendour and brightnes, as that inſtantly he became of a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour a Preacher. And although this by a happy chance did fall vnto him; yet that which was chance to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> was <hi>Prouidence in God.</hi> For thus himſelfe ſpeaketh to the <hi>Galatians, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>You haue heard of my conuerſation ſometime in Iudaiſme, that aboue meaſure I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church of God, and expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it: and profited in Iudaiſme aboue many of myne Equalls in my Nation, being more abundantly an Emulatour of the Traditions of my Fathers. But
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14091:168"/> when it pleaſed God, that ſeparated me from my Mothers wombe, and called me by his Grace, to reueale his Sonne in me, that I ſhould Euangelize him among the Gentills, incontinently I condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to fleſh and bloud &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>S.

Phil</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But now S. <hi>Austin</hi> did tread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſteps to the Apoſtle herein; for euen from his youth he began to burn with deſire of fynding out this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Pearle,</hi> that is, true wiſdome, &amp; eternall Felicity. For when he fel into the Sect of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> he much laboured with himſelfe, in ſearching, and diſputing with others, how he might fynd the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelicall Truth.

               <p>Now this one thing remaineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane, that a Chriſtian Soule do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ponder with it ſelf, in the ſight God ſetting aſide all other buſineſſe for a tyme, what kind of traffique this is, how profitable, and eaſy, during

For in a <hi>Penny</hi> is ingrauen the Image of the Prince; in it are alſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten certaine words, and the forme of it is round. Now <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of the inuiſible God, as we learne from the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>He is alſo the VVord of the Eternall Father,</hi> as <hi>S.

To conclude, the moſt wiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſayth: <hi>All things are obedient &amp; ſubiect to money:</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Lord of all riches, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Therefore it followeth, that the <hi>Penny,</hi> which is giuen to thoſe that labour in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> is Chriſt, true God, and therein Eternall life; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>S.

               <p>But let vs ſee, to whom this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Penny</hi> is to be giuen; the which who haue once obtayned, ſhall not ſtand in further neede of any thing. Our Lord ſayth, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. <hi>Call the VVorkmen, and pay them their hyre.</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:14091:172"/> Therefore it is to be giuen vnto thoſe, that labour in the Vineyard without intermiſſion, without ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without negligence. It ſhall not be giuen to thoſe that ſtand idle in the Marketplace, or to thoſe who ſpend their tyme in hawking, hunting, playes, or ſports. For the Reward or hyre is giuen onely to them that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is not giuen <hi>gratis,</hi> much leſſe is it giuen to thoſe that do demerit. Which point the Apoſtle confirmeth ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>The ſtipend of ſinne, is death; but the grace of God, is life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> The Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh, becauſe without the precedent Grace of God no man can worke well, ſo, as the reward of Eternall life may be due to him; But Grace being receaued (I meane that Grace, which is giuen <hi>Gratis,</hi> &amp; not by reaſon of any works) then the reward of Good workes ſhalbe Eternall life. And according hereto <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> thus ſpeaketh: <hi>As death is giuen as a reward for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſinne; ſo Eternall life is giuen, as a reward or ſtipend for the merit of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Ep.</hi> 105. <hi>ad Sixtum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are we heere to imagine, that becauſe the ſame <hi>Penny</hi> is giuen
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14091:172"/> indifferently to all the Workemen &amp; Labourers, that therefore in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen</hi> the Rewards are alike to all. For thou this <hi>Penny</hi> doth ſignify <hi>Eternall life,</hi> or God, or <hi>Chriſt;</hi> &amp; that Eternall life, and <hi>God,</hi> and Chriſt ſhalbe common to all: Yet here we are to obſerue, that euen as the ſame ſunne is more clearely ſeene of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, then of any other Bird; and the ſame fyer doth more heate thoſe who ſtand neere to it, then thoſe who are further diſtant: Euen ſo among thoſe, who ſhall ſee God and Chriſt, one ſhall ſee more clearely, and in ſeeing ſhall reioyce with greater pleaſure, then another. And as the merits of men ſhalbe different, ſo alſo ſhall their Revvards be different.

               <p>The Holy Fathers, who before the Aſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did cultiuate <hi>the Vineyard</hi> of our Lord, were <hi>Adam, Noe, Abraham, Moyſes,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs, and Prophets. They were called in the firſt, the third, the ſixt, the nynth hower; they not only laboured a long tyme, becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued long; but euen after their deaths for the ſpace of many Centuries of yeares, and ſome thouſands, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not to receaue their hyre, or vvages, that is, <hi>their Peny.</hi> But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Martyrs, and other labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who came to the Vineyard at the eleauenth hower (that is, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, at the laſt hower) wrought therein but few yeares, and preſently vpon their death, entring into the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> they receaued their <hi>Penny.</hi> Now how great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is this grace, that a <hi>Christian Man</hi> (if himſelfe wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14091:173"/> long tyme earneſtly deſired to arriue? Therefore not without cauſe, did thoſe ancient Fathers, ſay with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine murmure (which might ſeeme to ſignify rather admiration, then complaint) <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Theſe last haue continued but one hower, and thou haſt made them equall to vs, that haue borne the burden of the day, and the heat.</hi> But our <hi>Lord</hi> did apologize, and anſwere for vs thus: <hi>Friend, I do the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Certainly the Apoſtles laboured but a ſhort tyme, yet they brought great Profit to the Vineyard of our
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14091:174"/> Lord.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14091:174"/> New <hi>Testament;</hi> in regard of which Grace our Lord did rightly conclude his Parable in thoſe vvords: <hi>So ſhall the laſt be firſt, and the firſt laſt; for many be called, but few are choſen.</hi> That is, many are called throughout all the ages of the VVorld, to worke in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> euen at the eleauenth hower; but few are choſen, that is, not few in number, but that few men of one hower, and that the laſt hower are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the grace of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> by vertue and force wherof they made to themſelues great benefit by their labouring, and receaued in a ſhort tyme, moſt great Rewards.</p>
               <p>Neither are we to thinke, that all thoſe, who were called at the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth hower, did receaue the <hi>Penny,</hi> but only thoſe, who in that ſhort time, with all their forces euen breathleſly and inceſſantly laboured in the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> of our Lord.

               <p>THE fourth <hi>Parable</hi> is that, in the which our Lord in <hi>S. Matthew cap.</hi> 25. ſpeaketh of the reward of <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: VVelfare thee, good and fay h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant; becauſe thou haſt beene
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14091:176"/> faythfull ouer few things, I will place thee ouer many: enter into the ioy of thy Lord.</hi> In which place two things are promiſed to fayhfull ſeruants; to wit, moſt ample Power, and moſt great &amp; ineffable Ioy: <hi>I will place thee ouer many things:</hi> And which thoſe many things are, he explicateth in another place, when he ſayth. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſeruant, whome when his Lord commeth, ſhall find ſo doing, for ouer all his goods he ſhall appoint him.</hi> Now what other thing is it, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ouer all the goods of our Lord then to receaue power ouer all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, and to be made partaker of that Empyre &amp; Soueraingty which God hath, ouer all the vniuerſall Wolrd? Who is able to comprehend, how great this Power is? What King or Emperour on Earth can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the leaſt Saint in Heauen? But becauſe ſo great power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in man is commonly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on with much ſollicitude, care, and perturbation of mynd, therefore our Lord (as it were) to alleuiate &amp; eaſe ſuch ſuppoſed paines, adioyneth thereto: <hi>Enter into the ioy of thy Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; As I haue made
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14091:176"/> thee conſort and fellow of all ſupreme Power; ſo alſo will I make thee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all deſired reſt and pleaſure; the which no anxiety, toyle, or labour ſhall be of force to take away, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh. Certainly how great this <hi>Ioy</hi> is, which is promiſed to the Iuſt in Heauen, is altogether inexplicable; neither can we know it, before vve haue taſted it by Experience. In the meane tyme, we may make ſome coh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture out of three VVords of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſentence, that this <hi>ioy</hi> is moſt great.</p>
               <p>The firſt word is, <hi>Intra,</hi> or Enter into. It is not ſaid: <hi>Let the ioy of thy Lord enter into thee,</hi> but contrarivviſe, <hi>enter thou into the ioy of thy Lord:</hi> An euident Argument, that, that ioy is greater, then vve are able to contayne wholy in our ſelues. Therefore we ſhall enter (as it were) into a great Sea of euerlaſting and diuine <hi>Ioy,</hi> which ſhall repleniſh vs both within and without, and ſhall haue in it ſelfe a redundancy on all ſydes. Therefore in ſo great an affluency of <hi>Ioy,</hi> what place can be left for care, or ſadnes? The ſecond word is, <hi>In gaudium, Into the Ioy.</hi> Where is not promiſed this or that ioy, of this good, or that good;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14091:177"/> but euen <hi>ioy it ſelfe</hi> is abſolutly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to wit, <hi>pleaſure it ſelfe, ſweetnes</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Contentment</hi> it ſelfe. And how then can it be otherwiſe, but that the whole ſoule ſhall euen melt, and be diſſolued, being thus repleniſhed with ſo great a ſweetnes? And the third word, which doth mightely exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this point, is, <hi>Domini tui, Of thy Lord.</hi> For we ſhall not enter into a <hi>Ioy,</hi> at which men or Angells do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, but with which <hi>God</hi> himſelfe (in whome all things are infinite) doth reioyce. What Vnderſtanding can comprehend, of what nature the <hi>Ioy</hi> of God is, who knoweth perfectly his owne infinite goodnes, and who doth enioy the ſame, and reioyceth thereat after an infinite manner? And yet notwithſtanding all this, it is in thy power <hi>(O Chriſtian)</hi> to enioy, &amp; taſt, and to haue the fruition of that for euer, the which now thou art not able to conceaue in thought, if ſo thou wilt be a good and faythfull ſeruant.</p>
               <p>But now let vs conſider, to what men ſuch great Promiſes do belong. To them no doubt, who haue beene carefull to multiply the <hi>Talents</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to them by God. For this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14091:177"/> is borrowed from a <hi>Rich man,</hi> who deliuered his goods to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; entruſting one of them with fiue <hi>talents,</hi> an other with two, a third with one; ſtrictly commanding them, that by their carefull and prudent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation they ſhould labour to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the ſame. Now what theſe <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents</hi> may figuratiuely ſignify, the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the learned Interpretes are various. For ſome do by the <hi>Talents</hi> vnderſtand <hi>Gratiam gratis datam,</hi> which is, <hi>Grace</hi> without any interue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency on our part, freely giuen; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do vnderſtand thereby the holy <hi>Scriptures;</hi> Others will haue the <hi>fiue Talents</hi> to ſignify the <hi>knowledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> things, which is gotten by the mediation of the fiue ſenſes: And the <hi>two Talents</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and the <hi>Operation;</hi> and the one Talent alone, to denote only the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> But notwithſtanding this their diſparity of iudgments, they all iointly conſpire in this, That to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Talents,</hi> is to worke well, and painefully, for the good of their owne Saluation, and of others. There occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to me another Expoſition, not repugnant to the former, and ſeemeth
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14091:178"/> to be fitly accommodated to all thoſe things, the which our Lord did ſpeake of the <hi>Talents.</hi> And firſt, the Talents in this place are called the Goods of the Lord, for it is ſaid: <hi>He deliuered his goods vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is commanded, that the <hi>Talents</hi> by negotiation be multiplyed in the ſame kynd: <hi>Fiue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents thou dideſt deliuer me, behould I haue gayned other fiue beſids.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Talents</hi> are ſaid to be giuen to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, according to their proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ability; Laſtly, the <hi>Talent</hi> is taken away from the naughty and ſlouthfull ſeruant. Therefore I, by the <hi>Talents,</hi> do vnderſtand the Soules of faithfull and pious men, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the truſt and diligence of Prelates. For theſe are truly the goods of our Lord, the which he doth not giue to vs, but only committeth them to our care and multiplication of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Therefore according heerunto, our Lord did not ſay to <hi>S. Peter: feede thy ſheep,</hi> but <hi>my ſheep, Ioan.</hi> 21. Other things are our goods (though giuen to vs by our Lord) as Wit, Iudgment, the Scriptures, Grace freely giuen, &amp; all the reſt: but faithfull and pious Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14091:178"/> our Lord calleth his <hi>Goods,</hi> his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> his <hi>Family,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe:</hi> For theſe he came into the World; for theſe he ſhed his bloud to gaine theſe he ſent his Apoſtles, to whom he ſaid: <hi>I will make you to be fiſhers of men. Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Furthermore faythfull ſoules are ſaid to be multiplied in the ſame kind, when the Prelate by word and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conuerteth ſinners: Which thing <hi>S.

                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:14091:181"/> ſaid <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> which he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently written.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. Theſe <hi>Talents</hi> are committed to euery one according to his proper Vertue and Ability. For God, who knoweth the ſtrength, that is, the prudence, knowledge, Charity, and Fortitude of all men, doth not commend ſoules to any, but to ſuch whom he knovveth to be fit, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious inough to ſuſtaine that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And therefore no man ought to intrude, and thurſt himſelfe into the care of ſoules, eſpecially into an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall charge, except he be firſt called thereto by him, who diſtributeth the Talents according to the power, and ſufficiency of euery one: Since other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it vvill not ſeeme ſtrange, if many do fall vnder the Burden. Neither ſhall they find any excuſe with God, if they ſay, their ſhoulders were not able to beare ſo great a Burden: For it ſhall be anſvvered them: Who forced thee to vndertake a burden aboue thy ſtrength? Waſt not thou willing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, didſt thou not petition for it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouredſt by ſeuerall meanes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours to obtaine it? Therfore now ſuffer thy ſelfe with thy hands &amp; feete
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14091:181"/> bound together, to be caſt into exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour darknes.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the <hi>Talent</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſlouthfull ſeruant, is taken from him. And this point alſo moſt aptly agreeth with my former expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in teaching that the <hi>Talents</hi> are the ſoules of the faythfull. For he that taketh one <hi>talent,</hi> that is, the care of his owne only Soule, if he do not gouerne it rightly, he will loſe his owne Soule: for it ſhalbe made the bondſlaue of the Deuill. For as the Bleſſed do acquire, and obtaine the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of being the ſonnes of God, by the which they remaine in all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome where they will, and do what they will; ſo on the contrary ſyde, the Reprobate do loſe all Liberty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound hand and foote, neither can they vvalke vvhere they will, nor do what they deſire; but are forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vvhere they vvould not, and to do nothing of thoſe things which they would: and this is to loſe a mans ovvne Soule. So as this ſentence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, by the <hi>Talents,</hi> are vnderſtood <hi>Faythfull ſoules,</hi> is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreable to the Parable. Our Lord therfore did commit his <hi>Talents</hi> to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14091:182"/> three kinds of men; To thoſe, who were perfect (and ſuch ought <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> to be) he gaue fiue <hi>talents;</hi> that is, the charge of many people to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; To others, leſſe perfect (as the <hi>Pariſh</hi> Prieſts are wont to be) two talents, that is, a leſſer number of ſoules, and ſuch as are vſually contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within one Pariſh. To others yet more weake and infirme (vvhich are the common People) he gaue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, one talent, that is, the care of his ovvne ſoule only: Yet neuertheleſſe ſuch men ought to conuert other men by priuate exhortation, &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an innocent life, from their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the vvay of Iuſtice; and ſo after that manner, to multiply the talent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to him.</p>
               <p>And vvhat is ſaid of Biſhops and Pariſh Prieſts, the ſame is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of Princes, and of ſecular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and of Maiſters of families. For thus <hi>S. Austin</hi> writeth, <hi>tract.</hi> 51, <hi>in Ioan. Euery Maiſter, or Father of a Houſe, or family (euen by this Name) ought to acknowledge a paternall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and care to his family. It is his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiec in the feare of Christ, and for the hope of Eternall life, to admonish, teach,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14091:182"/> exhort, and correct them; in like ſort to exerciſe his beneuolence, and diſcipline towards them; ſo as he ſhall fulfill and practize a certaine Eccleſiasticall, or Epiſcopall duty, or function in his owne Houſe.</hi> And in this ſenſe <hi>Conſtantine the Greae</hi> was accuſtomed to ſay, that himſelfe was a Biſhop, <hi>extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam,</hi> out of the Church; becauſe he was moſt vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as far as he could) that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be preſerued and propagated; and yet he did not vſurpe, or trench vpon Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Offices, or Orders.</p>
               <p>But to preuent, that it may not be thought, that one only man, or one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of men is reprehended in this Parable, becauſe we read, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had but one talent, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and puniſhed; therefore we are to know, that our Lord from this one, would haue vs to vnderſtand the dangers of greater Nature. For as at the day of Iudgment, in that he will reward thoſe, who giue corporall Almes, and will puniſh ſuch, as giue none; we vnderſtand thereby, greater rewards to be giuen to ſuch as giue ſpirituall Almes, and greateſt to the Bleſſed Apoſtles, Martyrs, and Virgins,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14091:183"/> exerciſing Heroicall Vertues; and on the contrary, that theues, periured and ſacrilegious Perſons ate to vndergoe greater Puniſhments, then thoſe, who did not relieue the poore and needy with Almes: Euen ſo in this place, in that he who receaued one <hi>talent,</hi> the which he might eaſily haue multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and yet did not, is moſt grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, vve may learne, that ſo much the more eaſy it is for Biſhops, Paſtours, Princes, and Magiſtrats to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in this kind, by how much they do exerciſe a more weighty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous function; and that they are ſo much the more to be puniſhed in the laſt iudgment, by how much the loſſe of many ſoules is greater, then the loſſe, and ouerthrow but of only one.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare, what <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the danger of an Eccleſiaſticall ſtate or degree, <hi>Epist.</hi> 147. He thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to <hi>Valerius</hi> Biſhop; <hi>I deſire before all other things, that thy religious Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would call to mind, Nothing in this lyfe, and eſpecially at this preſent, is more eaſy and more acceptable to men, then the Office of a Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, if they exerciſe their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity though but negligently, or ſleightly.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14091:183"/> But in the ſight of God, nothing is more fearefull, miſerable, or damnable. In like ſort, there is nothing in this lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Truly the <hi>Shephards,</hi> vpon the Night of the Birth of our Lord (the prince of all <hi>Shephards</hi>) did watch all the night ouer their flock. And if this was done vpon a flock voyde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14091:184"/> by thoſe who figure out the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of the Church; how much more then ought it to be performed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, for their ſheepe, indued with reaſon, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt himſelfe, vvhen he was conuerſant vpon Earth, did watch whole nights? And if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Iacob</hi> waſted himſelfe away with ſuch labour for the care he had of the ſheepe of <hi>Laban</hi> his Father in law, as that he ſaid: <hi>Day and night was I parched with heat, and with froſt, and ſleepe did flie from my eyes;</hi> what inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable paynes then ought the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of the ſheep of Chriſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure? And if the Deuill, as a <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> goeth about, ſeeking whom he may deuoure; is it not then fit, that a <hi>good Pastour</hi> ſhould alſo daily goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſeeking whom he may free and ſet at liberty?</p>
               <p>But here it may be vrged, that the buſines &amp; affaires of the Church, of which a man is Paſtour, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times force him to leaue his flock. I do not deny, but if ſuch neceſſituds be of great importance, and can be brought to an end in a ſhort tyme, that then a ſhort leauing of the flock is pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Otherwiſe I ſay, let greater nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14091:184"/> be preferred before leſſer, And ſuch as are greater to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Paſtour himſelfe; whereas the leſſer may be vndertaken by ſome others. For if buſines doth force a man to depart from his flock; then greater buſines, yea euen bloudy Warrs do force a man not to depart from the defence of his flock. The Apoſtolicall Trumpet thus ſoundeth in our eares. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Our wrestling is not against ſleſh and bloud; but against Princes, and Potentates, against the Gouernours of this darknes, againſt the ſpiritualls of wickednes, in the Celestialls.</hi> And if the Captaine be abſent, who ſhall teach the ſouldiers how to avoid the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their Enemies? Certainly our Lord ſaid to <hi>S.

               <p>THe fift <hi>Parable</hi> (which is in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.) reſembleth the felicity of the Saints <hi>to a Great Supper;</hi> and this truly not without iuſt reaſon. In a Great, Nuptiall, <hi>or Regall Supper</hi> all things are there found, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Senſes of men, or which may ſhew the Power, riches, and glory of this World. Truly King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> who gouerned ouer an hundred, twenty &amp; ſeauen Prouinces, deſiring in great vaunting, to ſhew the riches, and glory of his Kingdomes, and the largenes of his power, did not find a more fitting and conuenient meanes thereto, then to make a moſt ſumptuous, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Banquet. For firſt at a great ſupper the <hi>Eyes</hi> are delighted in the moſt coſtly furniture and hangings of the Place, in the order of Officers, in coſtly and courtlike Apparell, in the golden and ſiluer plate, wherin the Meate is ſerued. The <hi>Eares</hi> are much delighted with melodious muſicke.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14091:190"/> The ſenſe of <hi>ſmell</hi> is ſatisfyed with the odour of flowers, of precious perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and with other things, breathing forth fragrant and ſweet ſmells. The ſenſe <hi>of Tast</hi> is rauiſhed with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſeaſoning of the meates of all ſorts, and with delicious Wynes.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the ſenſe <hi>of Touching</hi> is greatly contented with repoſing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon moſt ſoft and downy Beds. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at a <hi>Regall Supper</hi> all corporall goods do meet togeather in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt affluency this World can afford. So as our Lord willing to repreſent that <hi>Felicity,</hi> which comprehends in it ſelf all ſort of Goods, would compare it to a <hi>Great Supper;</hi> Of which Supper we alſo thus reade in the <hi>Apocalyps: Bleſſed are they, who are called to the ſupper of the marriage of the Lambe Apoc.</hi> 19. Furthermore, the greatnes of that ſupper of our Lord may be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in that the Glory of all the glorified bodies ſhalbe (as it were) the laſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vpon whome all delicates &amp; dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes ſhall be placed. Now the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe Dainties is ſo great, as that S. <hi>Peter</hi> once ſeeing the Body of our Lord, to ſhine like to the Sunne, ſaid; <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>It is good for vs to be
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14091:190"/> heare.</hi> And if the dainties of Banquets be of ſo great worth; of what dignity then ſhall the ſubſtance of the ſupper be, which is placed in the fruition of the <hi>Diuinity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, All the goods of this vvorld are nothing els, then as barks, or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the fruites of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And if theſe husks be of that force, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men with the loue and deſire thereof; what then are the fruites themſelues able to worke in mens ſoules? And if the fruites be of ſuch Vertue, what then may we conceaue the more ſolid and ſubſtantiall meates of this <hi>Great Supper</hi> to be? Doubtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhall be ſuch, as that they may be euer eaten, and euer deſired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any faſtidious ſatiety. Neither are we to imagine, that there ſhalbe a <hi>Supper</hi> in Heauen, ſuch as great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue in the celebration of their Mariage, ſeing in Heauen we ſhalbe as the Angells are, who neither marry, nor feed on Meates neceſſary to the mantaining of a mortall life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Supper</hi> ſhalbe full of riches, full of delights, full of Ornaments, &amp; full of glory, agreable to the ſtate of the Bleſſed. Theſe materiall things
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14091:191"/> are ſpoken vnto vs in this our exile, becauſe we do not here ſee better, or greater Matters. But from theſe we ought to learne, that that <hi>Celeſtiall Supper</hi> ſhall ſo much excell our ſuppers vpon earth (though neuer ſo dainty, or curious) by how much Heauen is better then the Earth, and by how much God, who ſhall prepare this <hi>Supper,</hi> doth tranſcend and ſurmount mortall Kings in power and riches.</p>
               <p>But heare it may be queſtioned, why the felicity of the bleſſed is compared rather to a <hi>ſupper,</hi> then to a <hi>dinner?</hi> of this point the reaſon is, in that the tyme of Dinner is about the midſt of the day, and the tyme after dinner till ſupper is commonly ſpent in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of buſines; whereas Supper is prepared at the end of the day, when as all negotiations are finiſhed; after which Supper followeth Reſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And therefore in another <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our Lord, the time of Dinner introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the Mariage with the Church his Spouſe, is begunne in the midle of the day; that is, long before the conſummation of the World. After
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14091:191"/> which time of Dinner, many matters of greateſt importance, eſpecially the Redemption of the world, and the reconciliation of Mankind with God, are treated. But after all buſineſſe and ſollicitudes ſhall ceaſe, then the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>Spouſe</hi> to the Houſe of the <hi>Bridegrome,</hi> and the <hi>Nuptiall Supper</hi> ſhall follow; that is, Eternall Repoſe at the cloſe of the day, and end of the World.</p>
               <p>But yet it will be worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to knovv vvhat is to be done, that vve may be admitted vnto this <hi>Supper.</hi> And of this our Lord himſelf hath byn pleaſed to inſtruct vs in this Parable, ſaying: <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. <hi>A certaine Man made a great Supper, and called many: but they began all at once to make excuſe. The firſt ſaid, I haue bought a Farme, and I muſt needs goe forth and ſee it, I pray thee haue me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. And another ſaid. I haue bought fiue yoake of Oxen, and I goe to proue them, I pray thee hold me excuſed. The third ſaid, I haue maryed a Wyfe, and therefore I cannot come.</hi> A wonderfull matter! Men are inuited by <hi>God</hi> to a Nuptiall and <hi>Regall Supper,</hi> and they refuſe to come: what then would they
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14091:192"/> do, if they vvere called to the labour of Warre, or to a long and perillous iourney? But this is humane blindnes, which can hardly be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue any thing, but what it ſeeth. But what is that which mortall men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before the <hi>Diuine Supper,</hi> which is our ſupreme and eternall good? Three things our Lord ſetteth downe, as maine impediments of our Saluation, which of their owne nature are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and yet through an affection to them not vvell gouerned, they hinder mans Saluation. <hi>To buy a farme, to trye Oxen, and to marry a Wife,</hi> are no ſinnes; but to aduance and prefer them before the kingdome of God, is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſtupidity and blindnes. And yet there be found many Chriſtians in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place, who do affect and ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe temporalities with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thirſt and hunger, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming whole dayes and nights in purſuing of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is noted in buying of the farme; and of Lucre or Gayne, which is ſignified in manuring of ground, or drawing of Oxen; and of Pleaſure, or Voluptuouſnes, which it taken throgh new Mariage. Yea they are ſo abſort in the depth of theſe earthly matters,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14091:192"/> as that they remayne wholy forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the eternall and moſt great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed to them that loue him.</p>
               <p>Neither are many men content to buy farmes, to proue their Oxen, to marry wiues, but, that they may the further depart from hope of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſeare not to inuade other mens farmes, to ſteale Oxen, and to maintayne Concubins, and proſtituted women; neuer euer thinking (much leſſe maturely conſidering) what hurt and domage it is for ſuch triffles, to ſuffer the loſſe of <hi>the Supper of our Lord.</hi> Certainly if God did not promiſe vnto vs (being but poore Wormes of the Earth) a <hi>Supper</hi> of infinite ſweetnes in Heauen, but only did promiſe the crums falling from that table, or the refuſe of the meates; yet it vvere moſt profitable for vs to contemne all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things whatſoeuer, that ſo we might feed vpon thoſe Offalls.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14091:200"/> fleſh, but through Virginity of fayth and manners, as S. <hi>Austin (in ſerm. de verb. Dom.</hi> 13.) truly expoundeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>I haue deſpouſed you vnto one Man, to preſent you a chaſt Virgin vnto Christ.</hi> Where, by the <hi>chast Virgin,</hi> he vnderſtood the whole Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in which it is euident, that all were not Virgins according to the fleſh; ſince the ſame Apoſtle in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> admoniſheth the faythfull matried Perſons of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore thoſe men and Women are <hi>Virgins</hi> in this Parable, who are not corrupted touching manners and Fayth, and flying from all Euill, do not contaminate their ſoules therewith.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it ſufficeth not to the perfection of Iuſtice, to decline from euill, but it is neceſſary alſo to do Good according to the Propheticall King. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. <hi>Decline from Euill, and do good;</hi> therefore the ſecond Condition is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; to wit, that the Virgin be <hi>wyſe,</hi> not fooliſh; Neither let her thinke it to be inough, if ſhe hurt no man, do not kill, do not ſteale, do not beare falſe witnes; but ſhe is to vnderſtand, that ſhe ought to proportion, and ordaine
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14091:200"/> means to her End. And becauſe <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> life is the End, and the merit of good Works are the Meanes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is annexed a third Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, that the Virgin haue <hi>light in her Lampe, or, a ſbining Lamp,</hi> which are good <hi>VVorks,</hi> as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> teacheth in the place aboue noted; Which very point our Lord himſelfe taught, when he ſaid: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhyne before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorify your Father, which is in Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for that good <hi>Works</hi> do flow from <hi>Charity,</hi> as from their ſourſe; neither can they be preſerued, except they haue their cheriſhment from the ſame <hi>Charity,</hi> euen as a light is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly extinguiſhed in a Lampe, if it be not nouriſhed, and fedd with Oyle; Therefore a fourth Condition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which is, that the VViſe Virgin euer haue <hi>Oyle in her Veſſell.</hi> By <hi>Oyle,</hi> Charity is ſignified, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the place aboue alledged doth teach. For as <hi>Oyle</hi> doth ſwim <hi>(as it were)</hi> aboue all Humors, ſo <hi>Charity</hi> is ſupereminent to all vertues, the Apoſtle ſaying: <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentiorem viam &amp;c.

               <p>All theſe ſacred authorities ſignify, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whether the iudgment be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall at the Conſummation of the World, or particular at the death of euery one) is vncertaine; and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God requireth of vs, that we be alwayes <hi>watching,</hi> and expecting his Comming, that ſo he may find vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and that he may not be forced to exclude vs (with the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi>) from his <hi>Mariage.</hi> Therfore to <hi>ſleepe,</hi> is nothing els, then to forget death and Iudgment, or to liue ſo heedleſly, as if we neuer thought, or tooke care of that ſo great a Matter, whereupon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Saluation dependeth. For we are not to thinke, that corporall ſleepe is forbidden to the faythfull; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would not haue beene ſaid in the Parable: <hi>They ſlumbered all, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14091:203"/> ſlept;</hi> but only Forgetfulnes and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Therefore euery good Chriſtian, who hath a care of his owne ſoule, ought euery day both morning and euening (the dore of his hart being ſhut from all other buſines) attently to thinke, and certainly to perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that that day or night may eaſily be his laſt; and therefore ought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to prouide, that he be not found, and taken vnprepared, ſo that he ſhall loſe, through ſuch his great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, his owne ſoule, &amp; all goods attending on it. Some men haue alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a horrour to thinke, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of death, and willingly they diuert their minds to other cogitations. But let ſuch remember, that the ſicke man hath a loathing to take his preſcribed phyſicke; and yet for the loue of his owne life, he willingly taketh it. In like ſort the eyes haue a horrour to looke vpon a dangerous and deadly wound in their body; and yet they looke vpon it earneſtly, and couet to receaue a medicinable playſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: So is it needfull, that a prudent man do make a greater eſtimate of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and loſſe of his owne Soule,

               <p>To inſtance this. The Law ſayth, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Leuit.</hi> 19. VVho ſo loueth his neighbour as himſelfe, runneth in the <hi>Race,</hi> and runneth for the <hi>Pryze.</hi> But who ſo paſſionatly and vehemently lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his Neighbour, as that for his ſake, he is not affraid to offend <hi>God,</hi> thus making of a man an Idoll; this man declineth to the right hand, and running out of the <hi>Race,</hi> runneth not for the <hi>Pryze,</hi> but for ſome vncertaine thing. And by how much he more ſwiftly runneth in heaping benefits and fauours vpon that Perſon, whome
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14091:206"/> he hath erected to himſelfe as an Idol; ſo much the more he erreth, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departeth from the <hi>Prize,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> But he, who leſſe loueth his Neighbour, then he ought to do; as when he ſeeth him to be oppreſſed with want and penury, and yet ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his bowells of mercy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration from him (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) this man ſtrayeth to the left hand, and neither doth he runne in the <hi>race,</hi> neither runneth he for the <hi>Pryze;</hi> although many other good Workes he may ſeeme to do. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to loue our neighbour as our ſelfs; That is, we ought ſo to beare our ſelfs towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as we expect our neighbour ſhould comport, and beare himſelfe towards vs; And this is to loue our neighbour, neither more, nor leſſe then our ſelfs. For thus doth our Lord God, who gaue this Precept, explicate the ſame, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. <hi>Luc.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>And what I haue here ſpoken of loue of our Neighbour (being an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue</hi> Commandement) the ſame vve may ſpeake of <hi>Negatiue</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. For who ſtealeth another Mans goods, declineth to the right

               <p>Another document is, that he vvho deſireth to obtaine the <hi>Prize,</hi> do runne <hi>ſwiftly,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly.</hi> He runneth <hi>ſwiftly</hi> or <hi>ſpeedely,</hi> vvho with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and feruerous vvill, keepeth the precepts, according to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that feareth our Lord, he ſhall haue great delight in his Commandements;</hi> As alſo of that other ſentence of the Apoſtle:

And truly theſe tvvo actions, I meane to runne ſpedily, and not to be weary, or not to intermit running, ſeeme to be meere Contraries, and hardly compatible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather. For he who runneth ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is quickly tyred. But he who will not be vvearied, runneth a ſlow ſpace, and vvith moderate gate perſeuers in his running. This thing is true, and therefore few they are, who do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue, and gayne the <hi>Pryze,</hi> or <hi>Reward.</hi> For it is moſt neceſſary, that he who coueteth to gaine the <hi>Prize,</hi> doth runne <hi>ſpeedely</hi> and <hi>inceſſantly;</hi> ſince the tyme allotted here for running, is ſhort, and the iourney long.</p>

               <p>O if Chriſtian men would haue a full reſent and feeling of theſe things, and of their owne dangerous eſtates, they would not ſo willingly rauell out their time in trifles, ſports, &amp; playes; in banquetting, and good fellowſhip, in heaping vp togeather of riches, in ſeeking after Honours and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as if the mayne matter of all were ſecure and in ſafety; But let ſuch men heare the Apoſtle preaching, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in theſe words: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>Take the armour of God, that you may reſiſt in the euill day, being cloathed with the Breaſtplate of Iuſtice, in all things ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>But alas, what are we to doe, that in this dreadfull ware we may come of with victory againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?

               <p>There are but two <hi>Landing places</hi> of the ſoule, for all Eternity, after its departure from the Body; And theſe two are <hi>Heauen,</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Either <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> muſt be its Lot; There is no <hi>Medium</hi> betweene them; A man cannot loſe the one, and yet auoyd the other, This then being a moſt aſſured Verity; and ſeing <hi>Heauen</hi> is made for <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> for the <hi>Deuill;</hi> why will men ſo much trench (as I may ſay) v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Deuills right, as to ſhare with him in his Vnfortunate Inheritance, and to remaine with him in <hi>euerlaſting fire,</hi> and ſo become the veſſells of Gods

               <p>Well, We are men, and therefore endued with freedome of Will, and conſequently with freedome of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and it is engrafted in <hi>Man,</hi> euen naturally, to deſire what is good and propitious, as alſo to decline from what is domageable, and euill.

I much feare that gnawing VVorme, and the broyling fyer, the ſmoake, and the Vapour, the ſulphurious ſpirit of stormes. I feare thoſe vtter darkneſſes. Who ſhall giue to my head VVater heere, and to myne eyes a fountaine of teares, that ſo I may preuent that weeping and ſtridour, or gnaſhing of the teeth there?</hi> But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neither S. <hi>Baſill,</hi> nor S. <hi>Bernard</hi> (of which the one was of the Greeke Church, the other of the Latin) were ſuch ſinners, who only through feare did ceaſe from ſinne: but they were men, perfect, learned, graue, able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others, and actually did inſtruct, not only the common People, but the Clergy and Monkes, reducing them to the rule of Perfection: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding vve ſee, they do not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or permit weeping for the feare of the paines of Hell, but they alſo commend it, exhorting all men to conceaue <hi>Feare,</hi> and to powre out <hi>Teares,</hi> euen at the thought of the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:14091:225"/> Horrour thereof.</p>
               <p>Now this foundation being laid, we will briefly ſhew, what, and of what Nature the <hi>torments of Hell are.</hi> And becauſe we will not wander in our diſcourſe, in groping (as it were) at vncertaine or coniecturall points, leaſt we may be thought to ſuggeſt vaine feares, thereby to force Teares from the eyes of the ſimple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; therefore we will produce and inſiſt only in thoſe things, which are fully and clearely deliuered in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. We find then, that eight ſeuerall kinds of Torments are read in the Booke of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Hell,</hi> to wit, <hi>Priuation of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Beatitude,</hi> which is called by the deuines, <hi>Poena damni,</hi> the paine of the Loſſe; <hi>Darknes, Fyar,</hi> the <hi>VVorme, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility,</hi> the <hi>Company of the Deuils,</hi> of which paines in the damned <hi>weeping and gnashing of the teeth</hi> do proceed, the which torments are called <hi>Poena ſenſus,</hi> the Paine of ſenſe or feeling; and laſtly <hi>an euerlaſting, and intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable duration of all theſe Torments.</hi>

Are not then theſe names, and words alone, forcing inough, to extort teares euen from our ſtony Harts? But where are theſe names read in the Booke of God? Giue eare to the <hi>King of Heauen,</hi> pronouncing his Sentence at the laſt Iudgment. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Depart you Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Come you Bleſſed.</hi> That is ſaid to the Reprobate, This to the Elect.

I know well, that many do much feare Hell; Neuertheleſſe I affirme the loſse of that Glory to be far more heauy and inſupportable, then the puniſhment of Hell can be. Yf I cannot demonstrate and proue the truth hereof by ſpeach, it is not to be wondered; For as yet we haue not knowne the beatitude of thoſe Rewards, that thereby we might make a iust proportion of the Infelicity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Loſſe of them. But this we ſhall infallibly learne, when expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhall teach vs therein. For then ſhall the eyes of men be opened, then ſhal the veyle be drawen away, then ſhall the wicked with inutterable dolour ſee, how great the diſparity is betweene Goods eternall or ſupreme, and goods
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14091:227"/> decaying and temporary.</hi> Thus much S. <hi>Chryſostome.</hi> Therfore whiles we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learne experimentally, how much the Loſſe of <hi>Beatitude</hi> doth exceed all corporall puniſhment, let vs in the meane tyme giue credit to the words of ſo graue and worthy a man. And when by experience we haue learned, that the burning of the fleſh is plainly intollerable, we may then prudently gather and conclude, <hi>that the loſse of eternall felicity,</hi> is (if it be lawfull ſo to ſpeake) <hi>more then intollerable.</hi> Therefore whiles the tyme is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and whiles that loſſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the price of teares, let vs not be ſparing of profitable teares, for feare that we after doe deplore that loſſe, but vnprofitably.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another puniſhment of <hi>Hell</hi> is <hi>exteriour Darknes;</hi> for thus we read in the Goſpell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>The children of the kingdome ſhalbe cast out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour darknes.</hi> And againe, it is ſaid of him, who was found without his nuptiall garment: <hi>Cast him into vtter darknes.</hi> In like ſort, of the ſeruant who did not multiply his talents: <hi>Cast you out the improfitable ſeruant into vtter darknes;</hi> Which very thing <hi>Iob</hi>

Iob.</hi> 10. And the force of Reaſon ſeemeth to euict the ſame, ſince the place of the Reprobate is in the Center of the Earth, to wit, in a place moſt diſcoſted and remote from the Seates of the <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> vvhich place is called in the Scriptures <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. <hi>Infernus, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or the lower Hell; Cor terrae, &amp; Abyſſus, the Hart of the Earth, and an Abiſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luc.</hi> 8. For ſince this place is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thouſands of myles; it followeth that it is not penetrated of the ſunne, neither receaueth it any light from the Moone or the ſtarrs. And although there be fyer (and that Corporall) as hereafter vve will ſhew: neuertheleſſe it appeareth from the Sentence of <hi>S. Baſill</hi> aboue cited, that that helliſh fier hath the power of burning, but not of ſhining. And if perhaps ſome ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and duskiſh light be in it, it ſhall ſerue only to the end, that thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable VVretches ſhall ſee (by the help of it) part of their Calamities, to wit,

               <p>Now this darknes <hi>in Hell</hi> is called <hi>Exteriour,</hi> or <hi>vtter Darknes,</hi> that it may be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>interiour darknes,</hi> which the VVicked do ſuffer in this life. For now the vvicked and the Idolatours of this world haue their eyes both of mynd and body open to behould the felicity of the world, and therefore they repute nothing to be good, neither do they affect any thing, but what lyeth open to the ſenſes of the fleſh: As on the contrary, they loath and hate nothing, but the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miſeries of this life, wholy laboring with the ſtrongeſt bent of Endeauour to decline the ſame. But how Eagle-eyed ſoeuer they are to externall and corporall things, they are poſſeſſed with a Meale-like blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to interiour and ſpirituall matters, of which men the Apoſtle thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Their foolish hart hath

That the Wicked ſhall ſuffer a horrible puniſhment of perpetuall fier, the Scripture is ſo plentifull in proofe, (and this ſo euident &amp; cleare) as that no euaſion can be excogitated againſt the ſaid diuine Authorities, S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Christ,</hi> thus ſayth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>VVhoſe fanne is in his hand, and he will gather his wheate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the barne, but the chaffe he will burne with vnquencheable fier.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe ſpeaking of the darnell or Cocle in Corne, to wit of ſinners, ſaith: <hi>Caſt them into the furnace of fire.</hi> And againe: <hi>Get you away from me (you eurſed) into euerlasting fyre, which was prepared for the Deuill and his Angells.</hi> Matth. 25.

How cruell a torment did the impiety of the Gentils excogitate, vvhen they did expoſe <hi>Marcus Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſius</hi> the Martyr, faſt bound naked to the ſunne, being annointed all ouer with honny, and his hands tyed that ſo the bitings of the VVaſpes and the flies (the which he could neither by remouing out of his place, nor with his hands driue away) might more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him?</p>
